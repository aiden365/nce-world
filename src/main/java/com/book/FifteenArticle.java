     * UNIT1 A Question of Rights
     * Unfortunately, a crime was about to be committed but at that moment Lesley was unaware of the impending event , which would affect her life so drastically for the next two years.
     * For the moment at least, her holiday at the cottage had been ideal. She had spent many idle hours relaxing on the deck , reading , eating a sandwich when she was hungry and in the evening watching the sky turn from brilliant orange to peach and finally to pale purple , eventually the light becoming dim.
     * It was about this time that the mist would begin to rise from the cool water hiding in the dense forest that hugged the shoreline Late evening dew glistened on every bush and soon the loons' call would resound across the water.
     * She decided to take a last dip in the lake. As the cool night air touched her arms. She gave a little shiver and decided it was time to move inside.
     * This was to be her last evening alone, as Jeff, her former mate, would be returning Zac to her early in the morning. As the case in many marriages these days, problems had arisen between Lesley and Jeff, but they did not extend to Zac.
     * He was a good kid, just entering kindergarten. The couple had come to a mutual agreement , as dictated by the legal custody agreement . It stated that each parent would share Zac's care every second weekend and this had been her weekend to be alone.
     * Jeff was an architect, with a high-profile reputation, who worked in downtown Toronto, a partner in a private corporation which mostly did consultant work for the university. Lesley's company had been hired to advertise the new science complex in order to raise corporate money for the proposed building.
     * She liked her work and she harbored a secret ambition to manage her division of the company some day. After a whirlwind courtship and a fairytale wedding the couple had settled down to an urban lifestyle. However,
     * after three years and one child the dreamlike marriage came smashing down. One disadvantage of being young and ambitious was that both of them needed to devote untold hours to their busy schedules.
     * As a result of these late hours, Lesley became suspicious of Jeff's after hours activities. She accused him of making her part of a love triangle. The whole miserable scene was to set the proceedings for an ugly divorce in motion.
     * Daydreaming about those earlier days would not help tonight. So with a shrug of her shoulders she tackled the advertising assignment she needed to complete. Tomorrow would be a busy day with Zac arriving home.
     * The next day, as the morning wore on, Lesley became more and more agitated , and her mood became apprehensive , when Jeff did not appear. When noon hour arrived and he still had not appeared, she started making some phone calls. 。
     * None of their mutual friends had either seen or talked with Jeff that day. Until today, Jeff had always been very punctual about returning the boy at the appointed time. Lesley felt a knot forming in her stomach as a crazy thought persisted at the back of her mind. She was absolutely sure something was wrong.
     * Jeff sat with his head bowed. He was undecided what to do. The domestic arrangement with his former wife was proving to be awkward. He was frustrated at being able to see his son only on weekends and felt he was always making concessions to accommodate Lesley's work schedule.
     * Every meeting was turning into a competition for the boy's affection. 每次相见都变成一场争夺"孩子到底爱谁"的竞争。 His one desire was to take Zac away for good. The enormous decision to undertake this plan appeared to be presenting itself.
     * Today he would depart for a conference in California. This appeared to be a marvelous opportunity to take the boy and leave the country for good. He bet that he could pack sufficient baggage into his vehicle and then disappears across the border, gaining entry the U. S. A.
     * He gave little thought to whatsoever of the fact this act could lead to his conviction if he was tracked down by the cops. Meanwhile, for Lesley the nightmare continued to unfold as the reality of the situation deepened.
     * After 48 hours, the spokesman for the district police department assured her they would investigate Zac's disappearance. Her faith that justice would be realized was faint. The shock of the past two days' events made her realize that possibly her son would become one more statistic in the missing children file.
     * The police completed a preliminary survey after asking hundreds of detailed questions. Hot lines proved fruitless. Meanwhile, over the next year there were countless visits and interviews at the police station and her home.
     * The police appeared to be making no progress in tracking Zac's whereabouts. As the days passed, Lesley's frustration mounted and she felt a sense of alarm.
     * Eventually, she decided to take the initiative in continuing the search and she began to use well-established child find agencies. At times, boosted by hopes, she appeared to be on the right trail with a sense of disgust, but her hopes were dashed at the final moment.
     * These obstacles hope. After Zac's picture was circulated nationwide, telephone calls followed from strangers reporting sightings of a Zac look alike. Month by month her plan evolved into a campaign equal to a full-scale battle plan.
     * She paid an exceedingly high fee for specialized help, such as the services of an attorney. Lesley became determined to target every major city where Jeff normally contracted business.
     * As the months slopped by, Lesley's exhaustion became noticeable in her eyes. Her cheeks became hollow pits. Most days she felt as though she did not have an ounce of energy left because proof of Zac's existence seemed impossible to find.
     * Another year passed and her hopes dimmed. Unexpectedly, late in August a promising lead brought her to Los Angeles. The interior of the bar was dark. Her quest to locate Jeff and Zac had taken two years.
     * She had paid private investigators in American currency to help her locate her ex-husband. In her handbag she carried the necessary proof that would identify her to the authorities if she was successful in being able to bring Zac home again, to Canada.
     * She had been impatient for this moment to arrive for so long and yet now she just wanted to secure her son with a minimum of fuss. Now, right on cue, a tall stranger slipped into the bar and sat down.
     * One glimpse told her it was Jeff. He looked weary and older but definitely familiar. A chill ran up her spine . Close to success, she refused to concede defeat. It was the time to remedy the enormous sadness. This time she wanted a guarantee of success.
     * She stared straight ahead with a vacant look, trying to grasp the important moment. Vivid scenes, from the pass two years' search, flashed through her mind.
     * The following day, happily for Lesley, the headline of the local paper read, "Father turns over child, Mother slams system." Lesley and Zac's subsequent life could now resume some form of normalcy.
     * however, the stress and strain of the past two years would always remain as a part of this renewed relationship in the memory.

     * UNIT2 One Chance
     * The tiny antique silver pin lay in my hand. I stared hard at the solemn face looking back at me from the oval frame. I was looking for some resemblance between my ancestor and myself. Her brow was broad and strong, the eyes kind and forgiving.
     * She wore a stiff black bonnet , a high white collar and a coarsely woven shawl around her shoulders. In examining her face more closely, maybe I could identify some similarity around the eyes and the nose.
     * An inner strength shone from the eyes of this diminutive lady who had helped lead her family from Ireland to the New World. The times, in Ireland during the 1770's, were difficult for everyone. John and Lily Love and all the tenants of the Barren's Court Estate were suffering after terrible floods destroyed their crops.
     * The landlord was generous in allowing the land rent to fall into arrears , due to the difficult times. However, as weather conditions continued to worsen, the little family became pessimistic and felt desperate about the direction of their lives.
     * Nearly every family at this time had at least one member of their family who had left for the New World. The ugly face of famine was lurking everywhere. It was not possible with one acre of arable land to make a living. Late one night, after the children were in bed, John and Lily discussed the possibility of making a reservation aboard a sailing ship bound for America.
     * John had noticed a poster in the town square, that posted by a ship's owner trying to recruit people for his ship. John knew that conditions aboard ship would not be ideal for Lily, her new infant son and the two elder boys; however, she acknowledged that settling in America would be the only way for the family to gain some independence and to earn a living.
     * More importantly, it was rumored that land was free in the new country. Lily gave her consent to leave. In port, the sailing ship, Hannah, under the command of Captain Mitchell lay at anchor. The adventure of crossing the Atlantic Ocean bound for Philadelphia would take two to three months.
     * Passengers were assured there would be the best provisions and plenty of barrels of fresh water. Storms could be fierce and living conditions below deck would be primitive. John joined the long queue and eventually after a lengthy wait, reached the revenue table.
     * He affixed his signature to the contract promising to pay five pounds per person for berths aboard ship. The clerk returned the receipt to John indicating that the sum of money had been paid. Once under sail the three hundred passengers found themselves crowded into miserable conditions.
     * The smell of so many people crowded together was offensive. The breadth of the vessel was narrow and the headroom below deck minimal. As the tiny craft sailed out of Lough Foyle, and entered the Atlantic Ocean, it started to roll ominously and those aboard wondered if they would survive the long voyage ahead or be swallowed up by the enormous waves.
     * Seasickness was everywhere and people had no appetite. The food, instead of being of high quality as promised, was too often rotten and the water was brackish .
     * Eventually, the winds lessened and the Captain was able to set his sights towards America and become ably steering the ship on an even course . Eight weeks later, plus on day, the Hannah made landfall and the Love family disembarked in America and became American newest immigrants. Gazing at the mainland after so many days of sailing was indeed a glorious sight.
     * The difficult days aboard ship seemed worthwhile. Porters hurried along the docks pushing baggage. Little girls with ribbons in their hair scanned the ship's decks hoping to get a first glimpse of their father arriving. It seemed to Lily that it took forever to register and to pass through immigration.
     * John said that he would go ahead to scout out some land in the far west of the state. He would push on to the frontier with a bunch of other Irish chaps. Lily and the children could follow more slowly, harnessing the horse and cart to convey their scanty possessions. The stuff in the cart would include a kettle, dishes, blankets, a chair, a bucket and an axe.
     * There was a perception by the government at this time that the feisty Irish would resist any hostile natives refusing to retreat and thus maintaining the western boundary. The Irish, too, were pleased to settle as far away from the government as possible.
     * Instead of purchasing land, they would "squat " on the property erecting only a temporary, humble shelter to stave off the weather. Once their families arrived, they would inspire the men to build proper cabins. Neither fancy nor elegant, these log structures would be their first real homes.
     * Property boundaries at this time were not marked out with iron rods or stakes in a standard fashion, but rather designated by natural objects such as rocks, trees and creeks. Confusion and disputes must often have followed later, when these survey points disappeared.
     * After exploring the area around Shirley's burg, John and his sons rode over Sandy Ridge to survey the property below Black Log Mountain. It was here in a long narrow valley they decided to settle. The valley became known then, and is still called Love's valley today.
     * At the time, drums were used to forewarn that the natives were going to capture the forts , which guarded the western frontier. Daily life in this new land, for the early settlers, was harsh and difficult. First they needed to tame the land, chopping down trees, in order to be able to plant crops.
     * At times they needed to defend their land and be wary of attacks from wild animals, such as wolves and bears. Mosquito bites caused severe reactions of swelling and itchiness . Once the work was done, neighbors would gather for an occasional social function.
     * The children would play for hours chasing butterflies and looking for birds' nests. The boys would catch frogs and then tease the girls with them. There would be a delicious picnic lunch spread on the grass. John asked Lily to bring some freshly squeezed lemon juice for the picnic. He found the sour taste of lemonade was refreshing on a hot summer's day.
     * Some of the men would have a drink of homemade in the moonshine before striking up a tune on the fiddle . Square dancing was popular among the young people and the young lads would leap up to dance with the eligible young ladies.
     * Rivals for a young lady's hand in marriage would tend to compete to walk her home at the end of an evening. TThe romantic times were few and contrasted sharply with the stern reality of everyday life.
     * Neighbors were also few and Lily found she was very lonely. She looked forward to the occasional visits of the minister, Robert Ayers, who was a Methodist circuit rider. Meetings would be held in fields or small barns, three to four times a year. At other times neighbor women from over the mountain would meet to make quilts , blankets and cushions and to gossip about their respective lives.
     * They would share their secret fears regarding their new lives, their hopes for their children's future and enjoy each other's companionship. Twenty years slipped by and John Love died at the early age of 47. Several years later, son James and his family, as well as widow Lily, his Mother, made the decision to leave Pennsylvania and settle in Canada.
     * They made the arduous trek over Indian trails, crossing the Niagara River to settle in what we now call Ontario. I am a Canadian. Having traced my roots and followed in the footsteps of these early settlers, I feel a sense of gratitude to my ancestors who faced extreme difficulties and severe hardship to settle in a new land. Liberty, then and in today's world, is a priceless inheritance .
     * Once more, I glanced at the silver pin before returning it to the velvet box. Once again, I questioned, "What did I inherit from my Love ancestors? " I realize the answer has been revealed while writing this story. I have determination, strength, loyalty and a love of adventure. This is my inheritance.

     * UNIT3 The Man and His Castle (Ⅰ)
     * La Cuesta Encantada (The Enchanted Castle) is one of the most remarkable displays of power and passion in the world. This marvelous tourist site now known as Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument is better known as Hearst Castle. It is located six hours south of San Francisco and five hours north of Los Angeles. Sheltered by the mountains in northern San Luis Obispo County, the complex of 165rooms and 127 acres of gardens, terraces , pools, fountains and footpaths draws approximately 800,000 visitors
     * annually. To understand the castle, you have to understand the man who built it, William Randolph Hearst. And to understand the man, you have to understand the land upon which he built his dream. Born on April 29, 1863, William Randolph Hearst was the only child of Gorge Hearst and his wife, Phoebe. George was a multimillionaire who amassed his fortune through partnerships in three of the ever largest mining discoveries of copper, silver, and gold ores.
     * In 1865, George began to accumulate parcels of land by obtaining 46,000 acres of the Piedra Blanco Ranch on California's Central Coast. There he began a successful cattle ranch , eventually enlarging it to 250,000 acres stretching 50 miles along the coast. William loved the ranch where he spent his summer vacations as a youngster and a youth, playing in the rugged canyons , descending the cliffs and camping in colorful Arab-style tents in the mountains with his family.
     * Phoebe was delighted in exposing her darling child to the beauties and wonders of the world and spared no expense doing so. During one of their adventures, an 18-month tour of the historic palaces and castles of Europe, William began a lifelong love of collecting. With his first acquisitions, German picture books, he embarked on a 78-year session of excessive spending. He confessed to a love of the finer things in life and, as he had a bottomless purse, would never deny himself anything he wanted.
     * In 1887, while William was at Harvard University, he decided to take over the small newspaper, the San Francisco Examiner, which his father had accepted as payment for a gambling debt several years earlier. George would have preferred that his son be involved in the mining and ranching interests, but William declined this offer and was given ownership of the Examiner in March 1887.
     * He was determined to increase the popularity of the paper and acquire the best equipment and writers available. William's resolve to succeed inspired him to publish juicy tales of vice and stories full of drama.
     * and motivation. In 1895, he purchased the New York Morning Journal, putting him in direct competition with the distinguished Joseph Pulitzer and a circulation war began. Both the Hearst and Pulitzer newspapers started to include sensational stories about the Cuban Insurrection .
     * The stories greatly exaggerated claims of Spanish troops placing Cubans in concentration camps, forcing them to live under substandard conditions, disease-ridden, starving and dying. This style of reporting became known as "Yellow Journalism ". The newspapers were transformed as the scope of the news broadened and became less conservative.
     * Circulation soared as the public could get enough of the banner headlines and abundant illustrations. At the time, many people believed William actually might have initiated the Spanish-American War to encourage sales.
     * According to one report, when one of his correspondents, Frederick Remington, requested to return from Havana, William responded that if Remington would furnish the pictures, William would furnish the war. He was once quoted in an editorial as saying, "Make the news thorough Print all the news.
     * Condense it if necessary. Frequently it is better when intelligently condensed." Another classic example of his influence occurred when; merely months after he advocated political assassination in an editorial, American President McKinley was assassinated.
     * As an intelligent and dynamic business man, William generated increased readership by employing some of the most talented writers in the United States, recruiting figures from the literary community, like Mark Twain and Stephen Crane, and the previously mentioned illustrator, Frederick Remington. He also showed his initiative when he chartered a yacht , equipped it as a miniature newspaper headquarters, anchored off the coast of Cuba, and led his army of reporters into the field.
     * William's interests led him to follow in his father's footsteps, inspiring him to enter into politics. He was elected to the U. S. Congress as a senator representing the State of New York in 1902 and served until 1907. He was a candidate for the office of mayor of New York City and governor of New York State, but failed in both of these attempts.
     * While honeymooning in Europe after his marriage to Millicent Wilson in 1903, he expanded his publishing empire with Motor Magazine. The Hearst Corporation grew to comprise a total of 12 newspapers, including the Examiner, and 25 magazines, including Cosmopolitan. Not satisfied with just his publishing enterprises, he expanded his business operations into radio, and later produced movie newsreels . (To Be Continued)

     * UNIT4 This influential media giant was not without his faults. His prejudices were common knowledge. His career was blemished(玷污) by his offensive remarks about Spaniards, Japanese, Filipinos, and Russians.
     * He printed lies, forged documents, falsified stories of violence, wrote provocative editorials, and published sensational cartoons and photographs to support his opinions. William hated minorities. He took advantage of every opportunity to heighten racial tensions. His real motive for his hatred of Mexicans may have been the loss of 800,000 acres of prime timber land to the Mexican outlaw , Pancho Villa.
     * His papers described them as marijuana-smoking, job-stealing, lazy, wicked, and violent degenerates . Some suggest he saw the Mexicans as a threat to his empire. During this period, William met and fell in love with a young actress, Marion Davies. Millicent, his wife and the mother of his five sons, including a set of twins, refused to dissolve the marriage, which obliged William to "live in sin" with the woman whom the tour guides refer to as his "friend" or "companion".
     * With the death of his mother in 1919, William inherited the beloved quarter-million-acre ranch. At first, he planned to build modest ranch house on his favorite campsite but as he became more involved in the project, his vision of a monument to display his collections gained momentum .
     * Working closely with family architect, Julia Morgan, William created a glorious and extraordinary castle-like structure, blending Spanish, European, and Californian architectural styles. Huge warehouses were built in San Simeon to store the shiploads of splendid antiques, including entire carved ceilings and walls hung with enormous tapestries.
     * They could be installed in the completed rooms. Landscaping integrated exotic plants, hedges, and trees with native flora . As William was in his 60's, he had the insight to know he couldn't wait for them to grow, but he was optimistic.
     * He ordered tons of fertile topsoil to cover the grounds to a depth of five feet and full-grown specimens of the plants were trucked up the mountain for planting. With thousands of acres of land covered with grassland, trees, natural ponds, and man-made reservoirs available for use, William stocked the estate with herds of rare oxen and deer, and flocks of sheep and lambs.
     * These animals flourished as they were allowed to wander freely. Larger, more dangerous beasts, including tigers, ostriches, buffalo, yaks, emus, kangaroos, llamas, zebras and giraffes were enclosed in the largest private zoo in the world.
     *
     * The "complex" was ready for occupancy in 1927, but additions continued until 1947. Eventually it comprised the main house and three cottages, all of which are furnished with a variety of valuable antiques. Even the lavatories were specially equipped.
     * William's favorite room was said to be the library with its collections of more than 5,000 books, ancient Greek vases, and an antique Spanish ceiling suspended by cables so it will sway in the event of an earthquake (all the antique furnishings and treasures are anchored as a precaution as this is earthquake country). In the '20s, '30s, and '40s, William loved part-time at the estate with his mistress, Marion Davies. They entertained to an excessive extent. To be invited to the castle was a privilege.
     * Movie stars, politicians, businessmen, and even royalty were frequent guests. Many of these guests, including a British lord, Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, Amelia Ear hart, and Charles Lindbergh, flew to the ranch, landing on the private airstrip . Life on the "hill" was never dull. The visitors stayed in the main house or the cottages, depending on their prominence or their intimacy with the family and were free to roam the grounds, go riding on their choice of horses on the property.
     * Company was expected, however, to meet in the main drawing room at 7:30 p. m. sharp, principally to amuse their host. Dinner was a formal affair beginning at 9:00 p. m. this meal was held in the immense dining room, the walls of which are lined with priceless panels from ancient European cathedrals . Following dinner, movies were shown in the private theater, starting at 11:00.
     * There were, however, three rules guests had to follow: do not get drunk; do not swear or tell off-color jokes; sleep in separate bedrooms if an unmarried couple. Food was not allowed in the rooms. If you wanted to eat, you could visit the kitchen… if you could find it. Although William was closely involved in all aspects of the construction and decoration of the mansion , he continued his business and social interest.
     * No stranger to scandal, in November 1924, he found himself in the topic of headlines. The most enduring rumor was that, during a party on his yacht, he had found Marion kissing Charlie Chaplin. In a fit of jealousy he took a shot at Chaplin, missed, and accidentally his Thomas Ince, killing him.
     * However, even though the morning papers carried the story, the evening paper and successive editions printed that Ince had died of acute indigestion . In 1945, William initiated the Hearst Foundation and created the California Charities Foundation in 1948 (the name was changed to the William Randolph Hearst Foundation soon after his death in 1951).
     * The Great Depression took its toll on even the wealthiest and William Randolph Hearst was no exception. His fantastically decadent lifestyle couldn't last forever, and gradually his finances began to suffer, beginning the next chapter in the saga of excesses.
     * He came close to being bankrupt but Marion rescued him from debt, unselfishly selling her jewels and some other property to raise over a million dollars. In 1947, due to his poor health, he was forced to move permanently to Beverly Hills. Marion looked after him during this time, seldom leaving his side. When he died in 1951 at the age of 88, she was shunned by his family and forbidden to attend his funeral.
     * The castle, its furnishings, the artworks in the gallery, and 127 acres of land were given to the state of California in 1957. Since that time, the California Department of Parks and Recreation has kept the castle open to tourists. Today a visit to the estate begins near the site of the old airstrip. Guests are transported to the top of the hill via bus.
     * One can still see the signs giving wandering animals the "right-of-way" on the lanes. Deer, cattle, and sheep often halt the buses' progress up or down the mountain as they meander to the salt licks. Depending on the tour one chooses, guides escort the public through a variety of rooms, gardens, cottages, and pools.
     * The luxury of a bygone era is evident at every turn. From the moment you arrive at the stairway to the Neptune Pool until you bid farewell to your guides at the magnificent, golden and blue Roman Pool, you are reminded that a man had a dream. He had power and influence. Furthermore, he was prosperous enough to achieve his objectives and implement his dream.

     * UNIT5 Yip Sang, a Chinese-Canadian
     *
     * The British and Chinese signed the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, each providing their respective subjects with the right to benefit from full security and protection for their persons and property within each other's boundaries. Even though China did no openly allow emigration , in 1860 a law was passed which stated that Chinese seeking to work in the British Colonies or other places were at liberty to do so.
     * They had only to ship themselves and their families on board any British vessel at any of the open ports in China. In 1868, another treaty, this one with the United States, gave the Chinese the right to change their home and loyalty from one country to another for the purposes of curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents, thereby opening the gates for emigration from China.
     * The gold boom in British Columbia in the 1850's was the beginning of Chinese immigration from the U. S. into Canada. Many of these early immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong provinces to San Francisco. When they heard of the gold discoveries in British Columbia, many crossed the border into Canada by moving overland through Oregon or arriving by sea in Victoria.
     * When the gold deposits were depleted , these early settler stayed, moving into occupations like gardening, farming, domestic service, road construction, and railway building. By 1871, these were approximately 3,000 Chinese inhabitants in the province, only 53 of whom being women.
     * Since Chinese workers were know to be conscientious and reliable, several companies actively recruited them. As a result, it was estimated that 10,000 workers arrived between 1882 and 1884. In an effort to restrict the entry of Chinese immigrants, an act was passed in the Canadian Parliament confining the proportion to one person for every 50 tons of vessel tonnage . A head tax was also imposed.
     * Records of those who paid the head tax are still available for viewing in the National Archives of Canada. An article in the Illustrated London News in January 1875 gave some insight into the emigration process of the Chinese by conveying the ideas of changes they might undergo.
     * The author thought the modifications would be slight and principally external. He believed that, in an attempt to blend in, the Chinese would adopt American language
     * culture, and dress. However, because the Chinese brought with them a strong sense of their own identity, it wasn't necessary for them to cultivate a North American way of life, nor did they feel an obligation to abandon their traditions. Much of the article would be considered insulting by today's standards. In the United States, there were two opposing points of view. On one side of the coin, the Chinese were seen as an inexpensive means of providing the manual labor necessary to develop the assets of the country, most often in hazardous occupations.
     * On the other side, there were those who branded them as the "curse" of the nation. Some Americans applauded the Chinese but others condemned them as evil. Some were disturbed by what might happen if all the immigrants decided to stay.
     * Their distress was unfounded however, as most Chinese had no intention of staying. Their greatest wish was to accumulate as much money as possible and return to China. Guilds were set up to provide lodging and employment for the emigrants, for a fee of course. The fee ensured that the worker would be paid a decent wage and that his employer would not deceive him.
     * The accumulated fees amounted to a large sum, allowing the Guilds to help those who were ill or out of work. They not only saw that the worker received whatever was due to him, they also made him pay all his debts. The worker wasn't allowed to return to his own country without a certificate from his agent stating he owned nothing.
     * Many Chinese were able to save a portion of their earnings to take with them to their family back home. Often, after workers returned to China, they would revisit North America to accumulate more money. Before being allowed to board a ship in China, however, they had to prove that they were going to their own free will and were under no labor contract. Before the ships set sail. The authorities would visit to guarantee that all on board had their ticket stamped and were not leaving the country against their will.
     *
     * Yip Sang, born in Canton(广州旧称) in 1845, left China at the age of nineteen to seek his fortune in America. After arriving in San Francisco in 1864, he earned a living by working first as a dish-washer, then as a cook, and finally as a cigar roller. From the outset, he perceived that if he was patient and could represent the best of his race, his merits would be recognized.
     * Possibly the attraction of high wages rumored to be offered by Canadian railroad companies roused Yip San to leave San Francisco. He arrived in Vancouver in 1881 and worked on the western portion of the Canadian pacific Railroad from 1882 until 1884, first as a book-keeper, then as a time-keeper, and finally as a paymaster , before being promoted to Chinese superintendent for the supply company. The promotion made him responsible for hiring on contract and transporting thousands of men from China to work on the railway line in British Columbia. He supervised some six to seven thousand Chinese workers during the peak of the construction.
     * In 1885, he returned to China using the money he had saved from his CPR job. He remained there from 1885 until 1888, while there he married four different wives, a regular occurrence at the time for wealthy young men. He and his first wife, Lee She, had a son and a daughter. Lee She became gravely ill after their marriage and urged Yip Sang to take another wife, one who could be able to take good care of their children. Wong She, Yip Sang's second wife, was very young with "sensitive" eyes, but did not meet with the approval of Lee Shee.
     * She insisted he should marry third time, and this time choose someone more suitable to care for the children. Dong She, wife number three, was more mature and had the capacity to supervise the household and the children. Dong Shee convinced Yip Sang to take a fourth wife, Chin She, whose primary role was to be Dong She's companion. With his four wives, Yip Sang had 23 children, one of whom became the first Chinese Canadian doctor to be recognized in Canada. In 1888, Yip Sang returned to Canada with three wives——Lee She died before they left.
     * On his return to Canada he undertook a new enterprise. He became a merchant, opening an import-export business in the heart of Vancouver's Chinatown. Wing Sang Company specialized in goods imported from China. The company provided Chinese Canadians with merchandise not readily available in Vancouver and exported Canadian foodstuffs to China.
     * His formula of pouring as much money as he could afford into building and expansion couldn't help but succeed. In 1889, Yip Sang bought land on Pender Street in Chinatown and began construction of a complex, which still stands today. Initially being a two-story building with a ground floor storefront and a second floor residence, it was probably the first in Chinatown to be built of durable brick.
     * Customers of the store walked on wooden platforms covering the unpaved dirt streets to avoid tracking the dust and mud into the building. With the tone of success, Yip Sang added to his building. In 1901, he widened the street to accommodate three more shops, each with a second story above. He also added a third floor to the original building in the same year.
     * In 1912, to house both his growing family and his business, he built a new six-story brick building behind the old one and connected to it by a narrow corridor at ground level, and by an enclosed stairway extension on the third floor that stretched above the alley between the two buildings. Most of the new building was used to warehouse goods for the import/export business. Yip Sang's involvement with shipping companies and his own business demonstrated his understanding of the freight industry and his ability to work fluently in both Chinese and English languages.
     * In 1889, the CPR rehired Yip Sang to act as their Chinese Passenger Agent for their Canadian Steamship Line, a position he held until his death in 1927 at the age of 82. The demand for salted herring in china, in conjunction with huge catches being brought in by the fishing fleet, spurred Yip Sang to build a fish packing plant in Nanaimo.
     * The success of this plant led to the opening of a second plant on Vancouver Island soon afterward. Both plants were staffed by large numbers of Chinese workers and helped establish sizeable Chinese community in Nanaimo's downtown core. Consistent with Yip Sang's devotion to growth and improvement, he promoted and fostered education. Not only did he found the Ok Kuo Night School, he also served as its principal for over ten years.
     * His children went to public school, but they also received schooling at home from tutors hired from Hong Kong to teach them Chinese. Yip Sang took great pleasure in quizzing his offspring about their lessons. His philosophy was that by moderating the children's Canadian education with fundamental Chinese, the equation would result in well-rounded, responsible citizens.
     * As a keen advocate of education in Canada, Yip Sang also sponsored education abroad in China. The ling-nan University and Toi-shan Middle School in his hometown of Canton were established with his help. Throughout his life, he maintained an active role in Vancouver's Chinatown. He was one of eleven men, his contemporaries, who founded the Chinese Benevolent Association, one component of which looked after the ill, elderly or destitute Chinese in the absence of their families.
     * When he died at the age of 82, Yip Sang was not only one of the wealthiest merchants in Vancouver; he was also considered a pillar of the community. Yip Sang's descendants continue to honor his values and remain active in the Vancouver Community.

     * Unit 6 An Ideal Position
     * Life is good. My career in elementary education in Canada is now just a fond memory. I think back on the many years of service and I recall the many classed I taught, the different schools I worked at, the countless staff meetings I attended and the many committees I served on. I estimate that the number of faculty members I worked with over the years is in the hundreds and well over a thousand students have called me teacher. Is it any wonder that I can say that I always felt comfortable walking in school corridors?
     * Sometimes I worked with students at the intermediate level. In Canada, students at that level are youth in their preteen years as well as teenagers. When I decided to retire, I knew that the first step in the procedure was to write a letter to my employer, a school board, to resign my position. I postponed mailing the letter. I was reluctant to add the postage to the letter, knowing that once I mailed it, the decision could not be reversed.
     * Because I was a veteran teacher of many years, I would be eligible to receive a pension. I calculated that the revenue I would receive each month would be sufficient to sustain my current lifestyle. If I was smart about my spending habits, I might even have a surplus of money. I certainly would not need to pinch every penny. I knew the money would not come to me in the form of a check. Instead, it would be deposited directly into my bank account.
     * I could withdraw cash from my investments if I needed to supplement my income, my credit rating would allow me to be eligible for a loan when some unforeseen financial crisis a rose. I knew, therefore, that there was no reason to panic, as my future was secure even if inflation increased or a recession occurred. In either case my income would only be minus a few dollars, a fraction of the total amount.
     * I decided to take the plunge, but waited another fortnight before I mailed the letter. I even paused briefly with the letter part way into the mail slot before I thrust the letter into the mailbox. I knew that the simple act of mailing that letter would alter my life. I looked for clues to determine how striking the changes in my daily life would be. How would I spend my time? In spite of having many long yearly vacations when I could pursue other interests, I had not bothered to make an earnest effort to confine my activities to one particular hobby.
     * Would I find life as a retiree boring? What new adventures might await me? Would I use my time to volunteer at a hospital or maybe work for a local charity? Maybe I would apply for membership in a golf league. Maybe I would donate my time and work with the Better Business Bureau. I night decide to enter local politics and run for a position on town council or I could run for the position of Deputy Mayor of my town, or maybe even consider submitting my name to be a candidate in an election for member of parliament .
     * I would need to campaign and then wait to see if people would vote for me on Election Day at the polls. In spite of the fact that the possibilities all had merit, I had to admit that I only had a superficial interest in pursuing any of them. In fact, I was indifferent to most of the options.
     * Did I think they might interfere with other commitments or mean I would have to cancel other appointments? Or was I just too attached to the idea of teaching, feeling that it formed part of my identity? I examined my emotions about the new direction my life would take. Would retirement add a new dimension to my life and multiply my feeling of satisfaction or would the world apprehension be more applicable?
     * Did I feel guilty about not being gainfully employed when I was qualified and capable? As a certified teacher, did I feel obligated to work in the field of education? Did I feel entitled to sleep in late each day, or would that bother my conscience? Would I simply grow old gracefully or would feel that ridiculous? My instincts told me that although I would feel grateful for my good health, curiosity about other countries and lifestyles would overtake the desire to spend my time with senior citizens, playing board games, such as chess all day. Wouldn't I rather learn about other cultures and at the same time be an ambassador for my own country?
     * I began to inquire about opportunities and whenever I searched the internet for jobs, I always seemed be drawn like a magnet to the category of teaching. It did not take long before I found that there were countless positions available in many countries. Amid the listings I identified several that were for teaching positions in China. I decided that I would communicate with some of the people offering these positions. I sent e-mails and made phone calls to several prospective employers.
     * The feedback that I got from most of them was that they expected me to bring all the resources necessary. How could I pack enough in my baggage to provide what was needed? I was inclined to look for a situation where books were provided. I wanted to sign a contract for only one semester but found that most positions were for one or two years. I could sympathize with the amount of paper work needed to arrange for a person to accept one of those positions and realized that it was wiser for people to spend a year or two in one location.
     * I attended seminars by companies trying to recruit teachers. I found several companies that captured my interest. I began to review my options. I asked specific questions about the positions with companies that sincerely interested me. I inquired about how many suitcases I would be allowed to bring and what the living accommodations would be.
     * It was refreshing to realize that there was a big demand for people who could teach English. Several positions seemed superior in their benefits and they sparked my interest even more. I especially wanted to teach students at the secondary or high school level rather than middle school. I could hardly believe that I was contemplating dong this at this age of my life. At times I felt that it was a radical idea but I also realized that I had always had the desire to have this kind of experience but circumstances never seemed quite right. Now they were. I decided to proceed.
     * I made an oral agreement with a company. I read their written contracts, clause by clause; to be sure nothing had been omitted from the oral agreement. In spite of wanting the clause about staying two years to be deleted, I signed the legal contract after a few minor changes were made and initialed in the margin.
     *
     * There were many details to consider. After choosing the company that I wanted to work for, I still had to take a long time look at my circumstances. I decided that I would sell my car, put my personal belongings in storage and rent my house. A lot of time and effort was required to make all the arrangements. I decided to tackle one aspect at a time.
     * The first thing I targeted was to sell my car. As a matter of principle, I felt that the value of the car would depreciate over the time I was out of the country. The sensible strategy was to sell it. Fortunately, my niece wanted to buy the car. I made a list of things to take with me. I was advised to take auxiliary light. I packed battery-operated flashlights to be used to case of power failure. I included a waterproof jacket in case I needed to walk to school in the rain.
     * I needed to sort my belongings. I had to decide what to save and what to pitch out. For example, I decided I no longer needed my typewriter, as I only used my computer for word processing now, so I decided to give it away. I made many lists and developed a cold as a way to catalogue my possessions. As I packed items in cardboard boxes, I made a list regarding the contents on the outside of each box. I packed dishes in towels to protect them.
     * Many times I had to undo a box because I forgot to list the contents. When I finally snapped the lid of a box shut, I sealed it with transparent tape and checked to be sure that it would not loosen. I also included another tag, which gave each box a number because all cardboard boxes look identical. I was careful not to abbreviate the names of items in the lists lest that would mislead me as to the contents.
     * I continued with this method, which also created an index of items. It seemed the rational way to coordinate and organize things. I remarked many times during this phase of my preparations that I had not realized I had so much gear. At times I had to laugh at myself. My activities seemed like they would make a good script for a comedy. Maybe I should write a play about what I was doing and copyright it. It certainly would be good for a few scenes on a soap opera.
     * On the spur of the moment I decided to loan my sofa and my rug to my niece who was moving to a larger home. That would mean a few less things to put into storage. I fulfilled my obligation to provide proof of good health. I had a chest x-ray taken. I had a complete physical examination. I had dental check up. Because my health reports all indicated I was in excellent health, all of the health care professionals I visited encouraged me to pursue my adventure.
     * I renewed my passport, my proof of identity as a Canadian citizen. I knew that once I arrived in China I would also be registered with the Canadian Embassy. My family's reaction when I told them about my plans was as expected. Although they sanctioned my idea and supported me the endeavor , they were sad to think that I would be half way across the world for such a long time.
     * The frown on my grandson's face told me that the situation would be especially difficult for him and that he might feel neglected by me. Although I could scarcely argue with the comments of my family about their feelings, for their sake I talked about the time away from home as if it was just a few short days. I would be backing home before they knew it.
     * They suggested that I come back after one year for the summer and then return for the second year. I agreed to this plan. Five years ago, would I have thought that this was in the realm of possibility? I doubt that I would have. But here I am in China, in my second year of living in this amazingly progressive civilization, and I can honestly say that I have never once regretted my decision to teach in China. I must also admit that I have learned far more from my students than they have learned from me.
     * I admire their thirst for knowledge and they seem to thrive on challenges. They never seen tempted to take a short cut, always working hard and giving a supreme effort. Their tolerance for their English teacher's lack of familiarity with Chinese customs has been appreciated. They always are positive in their attitudes toward me and have helped me whenever they could. At times they have insisted on doing things for me that was capable of doing myself. It has become a habit to surrender to their wishes to assist. One student in particular always takes on the job of carrying my packages, saying that it is his pleasure to be my porter.
     * When I started to plan this adventure I had only a vague idea of what the country of china would be like. I could recognize their flag but was not even familiar with their national anthem . My comprehension of the customs of the country was very limited I felt almost ashamed at how little I knew. I did not know if they used the metric or the imperial system of measurement.
     * Would I buy fluids such as milk and soda in quarts or liters? Would I need to learn the Chinese word for gram or for inch? Indeed I had never heard the word 'jin' before. I knew little about the food I would be eating. Would dairy products such as skim milk and cheese and yoghurt be available? Would I eat only rice and noodles or would the variety of foods be endless? May be I would be enjoying a rack of lean pork ribs as a delicious treat.
     * I was unaware that there were so many dialects in the Chinese language. I had no idea how I would communicate but when I arrived in china, I soon found myself having a limited dialogue with Chinese people. They would try to speak a few words of English and I would attempt a few words in Chinese. However, I resorted to sign language more than words.
     * How much I have learned! It has been a wonderful, rewarding experience and the one comment that comes to my mind is "I wouldn't have missed it for the world! "

     * UNIT7 A History of Christmas
     * Christmas is the most cheerful and holy of holidays in the Christian world, which boasts of an estimated 1.8 billion people. Although the origin of this holiday was purely religious, it has evolved into a highly secular celebration each year. However, strong religious components are still conveyed in various ways each year. The two are intrinsically mixed in the midst of modern commercialism and attached to.
     * Christmas day fall on December 25th each year, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, the son of a carpenter living over two thousand years ago. Christianity, the movement following the teachings of Christ, roused the world over the next many centuries. It is said that the first celebration of Christmas took place in 336 A. D. in Ancient Rome. No one seems to know for sure if December 25th was actually the date of Christ's birth, but it is possible that Christian leaders in Ancient Rome wanted to replace pagan religious holidays that occurred around the same time.
     * Many secular symbols of Christmas have emerged over several centuries. Santa Claus, in his present form, is a fairly recent development whereas his origin, in part, goes back to Roman times. St. Nicholas was an early Christian Bishop of Patara of the Lycian seaport (in present-day Turkey) in the 4th century A. D. The Roman Emperor Diocletian, who persecuted Christians, imprisoned him because the practice of Christianity was illegal.
     * The first Christian Emperor of Rome, Constantine, later released him. Nicholas' reputation for generosity , kindness and miracles earned him a widespread reputation and eventually sainthood . He is said to have brought back life to the children who had been chopped into pieces by their butcher father. He is reputed to have placed some gold coins in stockings, hung by a fire to dry by three poor girls. He had hoped that the girls would be able to use the money to marry to avoid living on prostitution , the common destiny of such girls.
     * at that time. From this gesture came the tradition of empty oversize stockings hanging on fireplaces at Christmas time for Santa to fill with little gifts. From these roots, the present-day Santa Claus seems to have emerged. In some European countries, the image of Father Christmas is identified more closely with Saint Nicholas than.
     * with Santa Claus. The red and white suit, that Santa wears, is said to have come from the traditional color of early Christian Bishops' robes. Santa, flying in a sleigh pulled by reindeer , and going down chimneys, originated from an American poem written in the 1820's, by Clement Moore entitled "The Night before Christmas". In the 1860's, another American made an engraving called "Santa's Workshop" in which Santa, is portrayed in a lovely sunset,
     * scratching his chin, reading letters and checking a list activities which was revived every year in music and stories told to children during the yuletide (Christmas) season. Every year children write letters to Santa Claus before Christmas, asking him to bring favorite toys.
     * Santa traditionally navigates the frosty night skies December 24th without using a compass or a chart to plot his course. He, in his sleigh pulled by nine reindeer, usually lands on slippery sloped roofs. Clumsily , with his big bag heaped with toys and slung over his shoulder, he jumps down chimney and dumps toys under Christmas trees. Gifts often include a doll for a little girl or a train for a little boy.
     * He does all of this without disturbing the inhabitants. Santa then crawls vertically back up the chimneys and, without a trace, flies off, exclaiming the resounding phrase, "Merry Christmas to all, good night". He is back at his home at the North Pole before dawn on Christmas morning, tired but very happy after his very speedy sweep around the world. After a big yawn, Santa falls asleep.
     *
     * Christmas carols , or Christmas religious songs, began in the middle Ages when people danced and sang religious songs on village greens (central gathering areas in small towns and villages) in Anglo-Saxon England. A Christmas carol today is a religious tune without the dance associated with it. A strong religious tradition today, as in other times, is to go to church at midnight of Christmas Eve or on Christmas morning. A priest may say mass (in a Catholic Church) or preach a sermon about the significance of the birth of Christ.
     * Another very prominent symbol of Christmas is the Christmas tree. There are several explanations for its origin. One story suggests that Martin Luther was walking through a wood on a clear winter night admiring the beauty of the bright stars glowing through the branches of trees. He decided to cut down a small evergreen tree and take it home. He put candles in it to represent the stars he had seen earlier because he wanted to share that beautiful image with his family.
     * Another story tells of the bringing of an evergreen tree inside the home during winter solstice (December 21st) symbolizing the renewal of life in the dead of winter. It became associated with Christmas, which occurs only four days later. The Christmas tree was firmly established as a Christmas symbol by the Germans who eventually brought it to America. In Victorian England, people hung cakes and candies on it and later, fruit made of paper adorned the branches.
     * Modern commercial tree decorations appeared in the 1880's at Woolworth's Department Store in the United States, and electric Christmas tree lights made their debut in 1882. The first Christmas cards were sent in the 1840's in both England and America. Gift giving probably stems from the Bible where it is written that three kings, bearing gifts from the Orient , visited Bethlehem when Jesus was born.
     * We know that St. Nicholas also gave gifts. A later tradition developed, whereby gifts were given on each of the twelve days of Christmas, from December 25th, when Jesus allegedly was born, to January 6th, when Jesus was apparently baptized (the Epiphany). There is a popular song called the "Twelve Days of Christmas" that keeps this tradition alive each year.
     * We understand that Macy's Department Store in New York City introduced the annual Christmas or Santa Claus Parade during the 1880's. Today, in late November, or early December, a Christmas Parade is held in almost every city and town in Europe and America. Early on the night before Christmas (Christmas Eve), children are encouraged to go to bed early if they expect Santa to come.
     * They lay their heads on their pillows with visions of what the next day will bring. Santa is invisible to children since no one has actually seen him, his sleigh, or reindeer on Christmas Eve. On Christmas Day, families usually get together for a roast goose or turkey dinner served with mashed potatoes, gravy , cranberry sauce, and pie or pudding for dessert. Grown-ups will pour a glass or two of wine or other spirits .
     * Together, families will openly exchange gifts and gratitude. Children, including cousins, nieces and nephews, often kneel on the floor in front of the tree, excitedly trying to find presents with their names on them. On that day, warm receptions are extended to everyone, friend or stranger.
     * For many merchants, Christmas has become the economic boom season of the year. It is estimated that a major percentage of the annual yield of revenue from sales is generated during the month or more of intense Christmas shopping before Christmas. As a matter of fact, there has been some debate for years that Christmas has become too commercialized and that the true meaning of Christmas is gradually disappearing.
     * An escalating tendency has been to buy more and more expensive gifts each year. Some people go into debt, sometimes owing more than they can easily pay back. Some people are personally beginning to rethink this commercial approach to Christmas.
     * However, toy manufacturers and their contemporaries in advertising make a killing during this period. Christmas shopping hits a peak on Boxing Day, the day after Christmas, when stores offer great discounts to unload the unsold Christmas merchandise . This is usually the busiest shopping day of the year. Christmas has spread far and wide across the globe. My wife and I lived in Beijing last year.
     * During the Christmas season, we saw many Christmas decorations and heard a lot of western Christmas music in department stores. It seemed little different from Toronto, Canada. We celebrated Christmas much as we would have in Canada, except that we weren't with our families in our homes during that very special family-oriented holiday season.
     * We have great memories of Christmases of the past and look forward to many more great Christmas memories in the future.

     * UNIT8 A Time to Say Hello
     * The year began softly. The weather in Southern China was warm and so were the students. The unexpected events of the year to come began to unfold, much too soon to become only an innocent treasured memory. Something precious should be held tight and not let it go. It was to be a year of surprises and a year of love. The Chinese have an expression for it, Yuan fen .
     * AA westerner would only question why and how. With your permission let us share the experience together. He sat at the front of the classroom looking anxious but attentive. In those first few days, his eyes bright with anticipation sought approval from me, his teacher.
     * He claims now that he understood very little content in the lessons of the first few weeks. However, he successfully managed to give the appropriate illusion , of understanding well. He made me laugh and his peering was also delighted in his sense of humor. He dressed with attention to detail, and his neat appearance, whether in jeans or current fashion, was distinct, a cool guy!
     * There was always something enchanting in his smile, he was charming and handsome and he knew it! Moreover, he was a gentleman. His eyes revealed so much when they crinkled with laughter, the mask removed, or conversely remained inscrutable，like still pools of liquid chocolate, containing only a hint of belief.
     * His first writing assignment revealed the fact that he liked me and that he hoped we could be friends, very good friends . At that time neither of us suspected just how true that prophecy would eventually become. Inwardly, I just laughed. This was the first of several laughs that showed how little I understood. His presence permeated, my classroom and my world.
     * About a month later our lives began to intertwine and the delicately woven pattern of our lives began to become more intricate in the coming year. Relationships occur on many levels. Layer upon layer must separate in order for us to speak of inner feelings. It is up to the individual to analyze the variety of feelings at each level.
     * As time passed, we shared our viewpoints and feelings through conversation while chatting over tea and coffee, arousing the emotion deep in our hearts. One day flowed smoothly into another. Familiar experience for me proved to be exciting and stimulating for him. Western festival celebrations like Halloween，Christmas and Valentine s Day provided an avenue to celebrate together, to share warmth and good times.
     * Traveling to new places introduce me to an enticing new world. Every day there was laughter and underlying cares that carried both of us along to some degree of happiness. We learned together English and learned about life that year.
     * Strangely the gap in our ages did not create any barrier for our friendship, he young and vital, and I was feeling young again. He offered his assistance, whenever I needed it. He offered his company for comfort, when death visited my door. What did he drive from this agenda, but a few paltry , words in a foreign language?
     * May be it was all worthwhile, maybe it will open a window wide and provide a pass port to a new world for his future. Time continues to slip by as a rushing river. You no longer inhabit my daily world, only my memory.
     * From a distance your voice informs me that you are continuing to learn, you are growing. Some days you are happy, others not quite so much. However, here around me, there is nothing, only a ghost-like figure, waving from your window and a familiar waft of fragrance as I stand alongside your newly occupied desk.
     * There is nothing and yet there is everything. My mind remains idle, with only fragments of images drifting in and out. I can no longer be absolutely certain whether this was only a dream. We no longer occupy the same space, but I remind myself that we still occupy the same world. When we chance to meet, hands reach out; hearts embrace, and once again confirm the same magic feeling.
     * Such friendships come rarely in a lifetime. Thereby, I feel blessed and lucky.

     * UNIT9 A Preface to Murder
     * Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. Sometimes life deals a bad hand. Sometimes it is hard to go on. Sometimes evil triumphs over good. Nancy sighed heavily as she pulled her daughter s diary from the drawer. She leaned forward to examine the familiar writing.
     * A postcard with a colored sketch fell onto the floor from the book the drawing was a picture of a long curved sandy beach on a tropical island; of course it would be Montserrat. She felt clumsy as she knelt to retrieve the picture. Under no circumstances could she forgive or forget the criminals who tortured her beautiful Megan.
     * It was difficult not to feel bitter about the events of the preceding year. She had shed so many tears in the past year since her daughter s murder. Nancy recognized that she was suffering from psychological problems and had really become indifferent to the events in her daily life. She began to shake and then to weep. When would there be an answer to this damn nightmare?
     * Megan had attended secondary school at a private girls school five hundred kilometers from home. In junior school she had been a straight A student. Now in high school she continued to study hard, play sports, join the school orchestra, plus a variety of school clubs. As a joke, her friends labeled her a genius, often just to make her angry.
     * As well as being a high academic achiever she had a great capacity for fun. She thrived on an active social life. Slender, pretty and vivacious , she was the apple of her parents eye. Every year in accordance with school policy, a student candidate was chosen to travel and live in another commonwealth country for six months.
     * As Megan had an interest in a diplomatic career after completing university, she figure she would be considered a prime applicant if she applied for the position. A detailed essay was necessary to provide the committee with a clear idea of her intention. The selection committee would spend a fortnight reviewing the applications in an attempt to identify the ideal student. Megan also needed to undergo a rigorous personal interview, which would validate her academic background and evaluate her general behavior.
     * The interview preceded well, Megan taking the initiative to underline her strengths. After school some of her friends gathered for coffee in the caf near the school. They confessed to Megan that they were rather envious of the opportunity she might have to live in another country. They enquired about the details of the interview. Two weeks later Megan received a phone call notifying her of the successful results of the interview.
     * Her parents were slightly nervous experiencing some negative feelings about Megan leaving the safety of home to live in another country. They knew the experience would broaden her horizons however, her destination, Montserrat, within the past year had a huge volcano erupt , disrupting people s lives. Unstable conditions, loss of homes and fear of more eruptions all tended to breed trouble among the poor of the island. Her parents concerns were for Megan s safety.
     * Departure day dawned clear and bright. Farewells were made to family and friends and she was off for the adventure of a lifetime. Megan s arrival on Montserrat was both welcoming and initially uneventful . The island family where she was to live for the next six months, made her feels right at home.
     * As the pace of life on the island was more relaxed that at home, she was very happy. Her new schoolmates included her in their lives and she adapted quickly. Swimming in the warm ocean water, and sitting underneath waving palm trees in a mild climate, was a pleasant change from the cold northern winters.
     *
     * One Saturday evening a gang of kids piled into a taxi, heading off for a barbecue on the beach. Some of the girls decided to walk along the beach. Megan joined them, lagging slightly behind. She knew she ought to hurry to catch up but the moist sand felt good under her feet. Water lapped at her toes; the tide was coming in. the violet light of dusk began to darken the sky.
     * In the growing darkness a van pulled alongside her, stopping with a squeal of brakes. Before she knew what was happening two masked men leapt out of the car and began to chase her, grabbing her and finally throwing her to the ground. The gross attack that followed was brutal and unexplainable. Initially Megan tried to fight off her attackers by clawing at their faces with her nails. Using a coil of rope to bind her hands, the men were free to proceed. First a fist broke her upper jaw leaving her unconscious.
     * Then the hoodlums used a metal rod to crush Megan s skull and finally a knife blade penetrated her neck piercing an artery . After the crude act was completed her body was bundled into the back of a cab and discarded in a ditch in an isolated district far from the beach.
     * Realizing that Megan had disappeared, her friends dialed an emergency number, notifying the authorities of the situation. Once Megan s body was discovered, a warrant was issued for the immediate arrest of the two wanted men. Megan's parents were notified by the embassy. They in turn retained legal counsel and an intense inquiry began into the case. Those officials with an intimate knowledge of the island felt that the mugging was a case of mistaken identification and a complete misunderstanding , a misguided outlet for mounting frustrations on the island.
     * Megan s parents, Nancy and Don, cancelled all their immediate plans and flew to the island. Rather than wait for the small island ship to transport them to the island they were flown in by helicopter. After hiring a lawyer as an advocate for their cause , they began to work with the local police tracking down any angle of the case that would bring these creeps first to court and then to trial before a jury, who in turn would convict them to lengthy jail sentences.
     * As the days slipped by without any answers, they experienced severe emotional fatigue and life became a living hell. The investigation seemed to lag at first, but they were reluctant to interfere. The initial reports from this mess were inconclusive; many of the details not being addressed.
     * As paying clients they lodged a complaint with the Governor of the island. After several months passed, the authorities had a frank discussion with Megan s parents stating that as each day passed they were less and less liable to solve the murder. They cited other examples of unsolved cases and encouraged Nancy and Don to return home. Feeling both annoyed and frustrated, they decided they had done all they could here for the moment.
     * Once at home again, Nancy withdrew from community life choosing to spend her time alone. These days, if you went looking, you could often find Don in a local pub having a pint or two of beer. He, too, is unable to come to terms with the sequence of events that tore his family apart this year. Just thinking about Megan brings a lump to his throat and makes his head spin.
     * As time passed, it was becoming more and more evident that the stack of paperwork pertaining to his daughter s case was not going to provide any answers immediately, if ever. Tips provided by the public proved to lead nowhere. The records will remain open until the case is solved, however for the moment the natural rhythm of life has been destroyed. Can a family withstand such a tragedy? Only time will tell.
