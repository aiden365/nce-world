     * UNIT1 A Question of Rights
     * Unfortunately, a crime was about to be committed but at that moment Lesley was unaware of the impending event , which would affect her life so drastically for the next two years.
     * For the moment at least, her holiday at the cottage had been ideal. She had spent many idle hours relaxing on the deck , reading , eating a sandwich when she was hungry and in the evening watching the sky turn from brilliant orange to peach and finally to pale purple , eventually the light becoming dim.
     * It was about this time that the mist would begin to rise from the cool water hiding in the dense forest that hugged the shoreline Late evening dew glistened on every bush and soon the loons' call would resound across the water.
     * She decided to take a last dip in the lake. As the cool night air touched her arms. She gave a little shiver and decided it was time to move inside.
     * This was to be her last evening alone, as Jeff, her former mate, would be returning Zac to her early in the morning. As the case in many marriages these days, problems had arisen between Lesley and Jeff, but they did not extend to Zac.
     * He was a good kid, just entering kindergarten. The couple had come to a mutual agreement , as dictated by the legal custody agreement . It stated that each parent would share Zac's care every second weekend and this had been her weekend to be alone.
     * Jeff was an architect, with a high-profile reputation, who worked in downtown Toronto, a partner in a private corporation which mostly did consultant work for the university. Lesley's company had been hired to advertise the new science complex in order to raise corporate money for the proposed building.
     * She liked her work and she harbored a secret ambition to manage her division of the company some day. After a whirlwind courtship and a fairytale wedding the couple had settled down to an urban lifestyle. However,
     * after three years and one child the dreamlike marriage came smashing down. One disadvantage of being young and ambitious was that both of them needed to devote untold hours to their busy schedules.
     * As a result of these late hours, Lesley became suspicious of Jeff's after hours activities. She accused him of making her part of a love triangle. The whole miserable scene was to set the proceedings for an ugly divorce in motion.
     * Daydreaming about those earlier days would not help tonight. So with a shrug of her shoulders she tackled the advertising assignment she needed to complete. Tomorrow would be a busy day with Zac arriving home.
     * The next day, as the morning wore on, Lesley became more and more agitated , and her mood became apprehensive , when Jeff did not appear. When noon hour arrived and he still had not appeared, she started making some phone calls. 。
     * None of their mutual friends had either seen or talked with Jeff that day. Until today, Jeff had always been very punctual about returning the boy at the appointed time. Lesley felt a knot forming in her stomach as a crazy thought persisted at the back of her mind. She was absolutely sure something was wrong.
     * Jeff sat with his head bowed. He was undecided what to do. The domestic arrangement with his former wife was proving to be awkward. He was frustrated at being able to see his son only on weekends and felt he was always making concessions to accommodate Lesley's work schedule.
     * Every meeting was turning into a competition for the boy's affection. 每次相见都变成一场争夺"孩子到底爱谁"的竞争。 His one desire was to take Zac away for good. The enormous decision to undertake this plan appeared to be presenting itself.
     * Today he would depart for a conference in California. This appeared to be a marvelous opportunity to take the boy and leave the country for good. He bet that he could pack sufficient baggage into his vehicle and then disappears across the border, gaining entry the U. S. A.
     * He gave little thought to whatsoever of the fact this act could lead to his conviction if he was tracked down by the cops. Meanwhile, for Lesley the nightmare continued to unfold as the reality of the situation deepened.
     * After 48 hours, the spokesman for the district police department assured her they would investigate Zac's disappearance. Her faith that justice would be realized was faint. The shock of the past two days' events made her realize that possibly her son would become one more statistic in the missing children file.
     * The police completed a preliminary survey after asking hundreds of detailed questions. Hot lines proved fruitless. Meanwhile, over the next year there were countless visits and interviews at the police station and her home.
     * The police appeared to be making no progress in tracking Zac's whereabouts. As the days passed, Lesley's frustration mounted and she felt a sense of alarm.
     * Eventually, she decided to take the initiative in continuing the search and she began to use well-established child find agencies. At times, boosted by hopes, she appeared to be on the right trail with a sense of disgust, but her hopes were dashed at the final moment.
     * These obstacles hope. After Zac's picture was circulated nationwide, telephone calls followed from strangers reporting sightings of a Zac look alike. Month by month her plan evolved into a campaign equal to a full-scale battle plan.
     * She paid an exceedingly high fee for specialized help, such as the services of an attorney. Lesley became determined to target every major city where Jeff normally contracted business.
     * As the months slopped by, Lesley's exhaustion became noticeable in her eyes. Her cheeks became hollow pits. Most days she felt as though she did not have an ounce of energy left because proof of Zac's existence seemed impossible to find.
     * Another year passed and her hopes dimmed. Unexpectedly, late in August a promising lead brought her to Los Angeles. The interior of the bar was dark. Her quest to locate Jeff and Zac had taken two years.
     * She had paid private investigators in American currency to help her locate her ex-husband. In her handbag she carried the necessary proof that would identify her to the authorities if she was successful in being able to bring Zac home again, to Canada.
     * She had been impatient for this moment to arrive for so long and yet now she just wanted to secure her son with a minimum of fuss. Now, right on cue, a tall stranger slipped into the bar and sat down.
     * One glimpse told her it was Jeff. He looked weary and older but definitely familiar. A chill ran up her spine . Close to success, she refused to concede defeat. It was the time to remedy the enormous sadness. This time she wanted a guarantee of success.
     * She stared straight ahead with a vacant look, trying to grasp the important moment. Vivid scenes, from the pass two years' search, flashed through her mind.
     * The following day, happily for Lesley, the headline of the local paper read, "Father turns over child, Mother slams system." Lesley and Zac's subsequent life could now resume some form of normalcy.
     * however, the stress and strain of the past two years would always remain as a part of this renewed relationship in the memory.

     * UNIT2 One Chance
     * The tiny antique silver pin lay in my hand. I stared hard at the solemn face looking back at me from the oval frame. I was looking for some resemblance between my ancestor and myself. Her brow was broad and strong, the eyes kind and forgiving.
     * She wore a stiff black bonnet , a high white collar and a coarsely woven shawl around her shoulders. In examining her face more closely, maybe I could identify some similarity around the eyes and the nose.
     * An inner strength shone from the eyes of this diminutive lady who had helped lead her family from Ireland to the New World. The times, in Ireland during the 1770's, were difficult for everyone. John and Lily Love and all the tenants of the Barren's Court Estate were suffering after terrible floods destroyed their crops.
     * The landlord was generous in allowing the land rent to fall into arrears , due to the difficult times. However, as weather conditions continued to worsen, the little family became pessimistic and felt desperate about the direction of their lives.
     * Nearly every family at this time had at least one member of their family who had left for the New World. The ugly face of famine was lurking everywhere. It was not possible with one acre of arable land to make a living. Late one night, after the children were in bed, John and Lily discussed the possibility of making a reservation aboard a sailing ship bound for America.
     * John had noticed a poster in the town square, that posted by a ship's owner trying to recruit people for his ship. John knew that conditions aboard ship would not be ideal for Lily, her new infant son and the two elder boys; however, she acknowledged that settling in America would be the only way for the family to gain some independence and to earn a living.
     * More importantly, it was rumored that land was free in the new country. Lily gave her consent to leave. In port, the sailing ship, Hannah, under the command of Captain Mitchell lay at anchor. The adventure of crossing the Atlantic Ocean bound for Philadelphia would take two to three months.
     * Passengers were assured there would be the best provisions and plenty of barrels of fresh water. Storms could be fierce and living conditions below deck would be primitive. John joined the long queue and eventually after a lengthy wait, reached the revenue table.
     * He affixed his signature to the contract promising to pay five pounds per person for berths aboard ship. The clerk returned the receipt to John indicating that the sum of money had been paid. Once under sail the three hundred passengers found themselves crowded into miserable conditions.
     * The smell of so many people crowded together was offensive. The breadth of the vessel was narrow and the headroom below deck minimal. As the tiny craft sailed out of Lough Foyle, and entered the Atlantic Ocean, it started to roll ominously and those aboard wondered if they would survive the long voyage ahead or be swallowed up by the enormous waves.
     * Seasickness was everywhere and people had no appetite. The food, instead of being of high quality as promised, was too often rotten and the water was brackish .
     * Eventually, the winds lessened and the Captain was able to set his sights towards America and become ably steering the ship on an even course . Eight weeks later, plus on day, the Hannah made landfall and the Love family disembarked in America and became American newest immigrants. Gazing at the mainland after so many days of sailing was indeed a glorious sight.
     * The difficult days aboard ship seemed worthwhile. Porters hurried along the docks pushing baggage. Little girls with ribbons in their hair scanned the ship's decks hoping to get a first glimpse of their father arriving. It seemed to Lily that it took forever to register and to pass through immigration.
     * John said that he would go ahead to scout out some land in the far west of the state. He would push on to the frontier with a bunch of other Irish chaps. Lily and the children could follow more slowly, harnessing the horse and cart to convey their scanty possessions. The stuff in the cart would include a kettle, dishes, blankets, a chair, a bucket and an axe.
     * There was a perception by the government at this time that the feisty Irish would resist any hostile natives refusing to retreat and thus maintaining the western boundary. The Irish, too, were pleased to settle as far away from the government as possible.
     * Instead of purchasing land, they would "squat " on the property erecting only a temporary, humble shelter to stave off the weather. Once their families arrived, they would inspire the men to build proper cabins. Neither fancy nor elegant, these log structures would be their first real homes.
     * Property boundaries at this time were not marked out with iron rods or stakes in a standard fashion, but rather designated by natural objects such as rocks, trees and creeks. Confusion and disputes must often have followed later, when these survey points disappeared.
     * After exploring the area around Shirley's burg, John and his sons rode over Sandy Ridge to survey the property below Black Log Mountain. It was here in a long narrow valley they decided to settle. The valley became known then, and is still called Love's valley today.
     * At the time, drums were used to forewarn that the natives were going to capture the forts , which guarded the western frontier. Daily life in this new land, for the early settlers, was harsh and difficult. First they needed to tame the land, chopping down trees, in order to be able to plant crops.
     * At times they needed to defend their land and be wary of attacks from wild animals, such as wolves and bears. Mosquito bites caused severe reactions of swelling and itchiness . Once the work was done, neighbors would gather for an occasional social function.
     * The children would play for hours chasing butterflies and looking for birds' nests. The boys would catch frogs and then tease the girls with them. There would be a delicious picnic lunch spread on the grass. John asked Lily to bring some freshly squeezed lemon juice for the picnic. He found the sour taste of lemonade was refreshing on a hot summer's day.
     * Some of the men would have a drink of homemade in the moonshine before striking up a tune on the fiddle . Square dancing was popular among the young people and the young lads would leap up to dance with the eligible young ladies.
     * Rivals for a young lady's hand in marriage would tend to compete to walk her home at the end of an evening. TThe romantic times were few and contrasted sharply with the stern reality of everyday life.
     * Neighbors were also few and Lily found she was very lonely. She looked forward to the occasional visits of the minister, Robert Ayers, who was a Methodist circuit rider. Meetings would be held in fields or small barns, three to four times a year. At other times neighbor women from over the mountain would meet to make quilts , blankets and cushions and to gossip about their respective lives.
     * They would share their secret fears regarding their new lives, their hopes for their children's future and enjoy each other's companionship. Twenty years slipped by and John Love died at the early age of 47. Several years later, son James and his family, as well as widow Lily, his Mother, made the decision to leave Pennsylvania and settle in Canada.
     * They made the arduous trek over Indian trails, crossing the Niagara River to settle in what we now call Ontario. I am a Canadian. Having traced my roots and followed in the footsteps of these early settlers, I feel a sense of gratitude to my ancestors who faced extreme difficulties and severe hardship to settle in a new land. Liberty, then and in today's world, is a priceless inheritance .
     * Once more, I glanced at the silver pin before returning it to the velvet box. Once again, I questioned, "What did I inherit from my Love ancestors? " I realize the answer has been revealed while writing this story. I have determination, strength, loyalty and a love of adventure. This is my inheritance.

     * UNIT3 The Man and His Castle (Ⅰ)
     * La Cuesta Encantada (The Enchanted Castle) is one of the most remarkable displays of power and passion in the world. This marvelous tourist site now known as Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument is better known as Hearst Castle. It is located six hours south of San Francisco and five hours north of Los Angeles. Sheltered by the mountains in northern San Luis Obispo County, the complex of 165rooms and 127 acres of gardens, terraces , pools, fountains and footpaths draws approximately 800,000 visitors
     * annually. To understand the castle, you have to understand the man who built it, William Randolph Hearst. And to understand the man, you have to understand the land upon which he built his dream. Born on April 29, 1863, William Randolph Hearst was the only child of Gorge Hearst and his wife, Phoebe. George was a multimillionaire who amassed his fortune through partnerships in three of the ever largest mining discoveries of copper, silver, and gold ores.
     * In 1865, George began to accumulate parcels of land by obtaining 46,000 acres of the Piedra Blanco Ranch on California's Central Coast. There he began a successful cattle ranch , eventually enlarging it to 250,000 acres stretching 50 miles along the coast. William loved the ranch where he spent his summer vacations as a youngster and a youth, playing in the rugged canyons , descending the cliffs and camping in colorful Arab-style tents in the mountains with his family.
     * Phoebe was delighted in exposing her darling child to the beauties and wonders of the world and spared no expense doing so. During one of their adventures, an 18-month tour of the historic palaces and castles of Europe, William began a lifelong love of collecting. With his first acquisitions, German picture books, he embarked on a 78-year session of excessive spending. He confessed to a love of the finer things in life and, as he had a bottomless purse, would never deny himself anything he wanted.
     * In 1887, while William was at Harvard University, he decided to take over the small newspaper, the San Francisco Examiner, which his father had accepted as payment for a gambling debt several years earlier. George would have preferred that his son be involved in the mining and ranching interests, but William declined this offer and was given ownership of the Examiner in March 1887.
     * He was determined to increase the popularity of the paper and acquire the best equipment and writers available. William's resolve to succeed inspired him to publish juicy tales of vice and stories full of drama.
     * and motivation. In 1895, he purchased the New York Morning Journal, putting him in direct competition with the distinguished Joseph Pulitzer and a circulation war began. Both the Hearst and Pulitzer newspapers started to include sensational stories about the Cuban Insurrection .
     * The stories greatly exaggerated claims of Spanish troops placing Cubans in concentration camps, forcing them to live under substandard conditions, disease-ridden, starving and dying. This style of reporting became known as "Yellow Journalism ". The newspapers were transformed as the scope of the news broadened and became less conservative.
     * Circulation soared as the public could get enough of the banner headlines and abundant illustrations. At the time, many people believed William actually might have initiated the Spanish-American War to encourage sales.
     * According to one report, when one of his correspondents, Frederick Remington, requested to return from Havana, William responded that if Remington would furnish the pictures, William would furnish the war. He was once quoted in an editorial as saying, "Make the news thorough Print all the news.
     * Condense it if necessary. Frequently it is better when intelligently condensed." Another classic example of his influence occurred when; merely months after he advocated political assassination in an editorial, American President McKinley was assassinated.
     * As an intelligent and dynamic business man, William generated increased readership by employing some of the most talented writers in the United States, recruiting figures from the literary community, like Mark Twain and Stephen Crane, and the previously mentioned illustrator, Frederick Remington. He also showed his initiative when he chartered a yacht , equipped it as a miniature newspaper headquarters, anchored off the coast of Cuba, and led his army of reporters into the field.
     * William's interests led him to follow in his father's footsteps, inspiring him to enter into politics. He was elected to the U. S. Congress as a senator representing the State of New York in 1902 and served until 1907. He was a candidate for the office of mayor of New York City and governor of New York State, but failed in both of these attempts.
     * While honeymooning in Europe after his marriage to Millicent Wilson in 1903, he expanded his publishing empire with Motor Magazine. The Hearst Corporation grew to comprise a total of 12 newspapers, including the Examiner, and 25 magazines, including Cosmopolitan. Not satisfied with just his publishing enterprises, he expanded his business operations into radio, and later produced movie newsreels . (To Be Continued)

     * UNIT4 This influential media giant was not without his faults. His prejudices were common knowledge. His career was blemished(玷污) by his offensive remarks about Spaniards, Japanese, Filipinos, and Russians.
     * He printed lies, forged documents, falsified stories of violence, wrote provocative editorials, and published sensational cartoons and photographs to support his opinions. William hated minorities. He took advantage of every opportunity to heighten racial tensions. His real motive for his hatred of Mexicans may have been the loss of 800,000 acres of prime timber land to the Mexican outlaw , Pancho Villa.
     * His papers described them as marijuana-smoking, job-stealing, lazy, wicked, and violent degenerates . Some suggest he saw the Mexicans as a threat to his empire. During this period, William met and fell in love with a young actress, Marion Davies. Millicent, his wife and the mother of his five sons, including a set of twins, refused to dissolve the marriage, which obliged William to "live in sin" with the woman whom the tour guides refer to as his "friend" or "companion".
     * With the death of his mother in 1919, William inherited the beloved quarter-million-acre ranch. At first, he planned to build modest ranch house on his favorite campsite but as he became more involved in the project, his vision of a monument to display his collections gained momentum .
     * Working closely with family architect, Julia Morgan, William created a glorious and extraordinary castle-like structure, blending Spanish, European, and Californian architectural styles. Huge warehouses were built in San Simeon to store the shiploads of splendid antiques, including entire carved ceilings and walls hung with enormous tapestries.
     * They could be installed in the completed rooms. Landscaping integrated exotic plants, hedges, and trees with native flora . As William was in his 60's, he had the insight to know he couldn't wait for them to grow, but he was optimistic.
     * He ordered tons of fertile topsoil to cover the grounds to a depth of five feet and full-grown specimens of the plants were trucked up the mountain for planting. With thousands of acres of land covered with grassland, trees, natural ponds, and man-made reservoirs available for use, William stocked the estate with herds of rare oxen and deer, and flocks of sheep and lambs.
     * These animals flourished as they were allowed to wander freely. Larger, more dangerous beasts, including tigers, ostriches, buffalo, yaks, emus, kangaroos, llamas, zebras and giraffes were enclosed in the largest private zoo in the world.
     *
     * The "complex" was ready for occupancy in 1927, but additions continued until 1947. Eventually it comprised the main house and three cottages, all of which are furnished with a variety of valuable antiques. Even the lavatories were specially equipped.
     * William's favorite room was said to be the library with its collections of more than 5,000 books, ancient Greek vases, and an antique Spanish ceiling suspended by cables so it will sway in the event of an earthquake (all the antique furnishings and treasures are anchored as a precaution as this is earthquake country). In the '20s, '30s, and '40s, William loved part-time at the estate with his mistress, Marion Davies. They entertained to an excessive extent. To be invited to the castle was a privilege.
     * Movie stars, politicians, businessmen, and even royalty were frequent guests. Many of these guests, including a British lord, Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, Amelia Ear hart, and Charles Lindbergh, flew to the ranch, landing on the private airstrip . Life on the "hill" was never dull. The visitors stayed in the main house or the cottages, depending on their prominence or their intimacy with the family and were free to roam the grounds, go riding on their choice of horses on the property.
     * Company was expected, however, to meet in the main drawing room at 7:30 p. m. sharp, principally to amuse their host. Dinner was a formal affair beginning at 9:00 p. m. this meal was held in the immense dining room, the walls of which are lined with priceless panels from ancient European cathedrals . Following dinner, movies were shown in the private theater, starting at 11:00.
     * There were, however, three rules guests had to follow: do not get drunk; do not swear or tell off-color jokes; sleep in separate bedrooms if an unmarried couple. Food was not allowed in the rooms. If you wanted to eat, you could visit the kitchen… if you could find it. Although William was closely involved in all aspects of the construction and decoration of the mansion , he continued his business and social interest.
     * No stranger to scandal, in November 1924, he found himself in the topic of headlines. The most enduring rumor was that, during a party on his yacht, he had found Marion kissing Charlie Chaplin. In a fit of jealousy he took a shot at Chaplin, missed, and accidentally his Thomas Ince, killing him.
     * However, even though the morning papers carried the story, the evening paper and successive editions printed that Ince had died of acute indigestion . In 1945, William initiated the Hearst Foundation and created the California Charities Foundation in 1948 (the name was changed to the William Randolph Hearst Foundation soon after his death in 1951).
     * The Great Depression took its toll on even the wealthiest and William Randolph Hearst was no exception. His fantastically decadent lifestyle couldn't last forever, and gradually his finances began to suffer, beginning the next chapter in the saga of excesses.
     * He came close to being bankrupt but Marion rescued him from debt, unselfishly selling her jewels and some other property to raise over a million dollars. In 1947, due to his poor health, he was forced to move permanently to Beverly Hills. Marion looked after him during this time, seldom leaving his side. When he died in 1951 at the age of 88, she was shunned by his family and forbidden to attend his funeral.
     * The castle, its furnishings, the artworks in the gallery, and 127 acres of land were given to the state of California in 1957. Since that time, the California Department of Parks and Recreation has kept the castle open to tourists. Today a visit to the estate begins near the site of the old airstrip. Guests are transported to the top of the hill via bus.
     * One can still see the signs giving wandering animals the "right-of-way" on the lanes. Deer, cattle, and sheep often halt the buses' progress up or down the mountain as they meander to the salt licks. Depending on the tour one chooses, guides escort the public through a variety of rooms, gardens, cottages, and pools.
     * The luxury of a bygone era is evident at every turn. From the moment you arrive at the stairway to the Neptune Pool until you bid farewell to your guides at the magnificent, golden and blue Roman Pool, you are reminded that a man had a dream. He had power and influence. Furthermore, he was prosperous enough to achieve his objectives and implement his dream.
