UNIT12 The Duct Tape
Among the contents of the toolboxes of most people in the western world you would expect to find a hammer and nails, a drill, screwdrivers and some screws.
But if you were to ask people from North America what the most useful item in their toolboxes was, the majority of people would undoubtedly tell you that it was duct tape.
Indeed, it has become an indispensable addition to every person s perception of what constitutes necessity.
Maybe you have never heard of duct tape.
It is the brand name of a tape.
Not only is it a tape, but also it is a special kind of tape.
The name of the tape comes from the fact that it was designed as an insulating tape that can be used in duct work (channels or conduits that are used for heat to travel through to get to different areas of a building).
Incredible though it seems, someone actually put a picture of a duck on the packaging of the tape from one manufacturer perhaps just as a joke or maybe because the design artist did not understand the origin of the name.
Neither the word duck nor duct was on the label.
Presumably, it was assumed that everyone could identify the product.
You can recognize the genuine tape because of its silver grey color.
The color was likely chosen because it closely resembles the color of the pipes the color of the pipes it would be used on.
That was the primary intended use of the tape.

The number of uses for this tape will amaze you.

Maybe there are an infinite number of uses.
Some of the items it lists involve an imagination but others are quite genuine.

However, some of the uses are not feasible to execute.
