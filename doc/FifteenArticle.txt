UNIT9 A Preface to Murder
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.
Sometimes life deals a bad hand
Sometimes it is hard to go on
Sometimes evil triumphs over good
Nancy sighed heavily as she pulled her daughter s diary from the drawer
She leaned forward to examine the familiar writing.
A postcard with a colored sketch fell onto the floor from the book the drawing was a picture of a long curved sandy beach on a tropical island; of course it would be Montserrat
She felt clumsy as she knelt to retrieve the picture
Under no circumstances could she forgive or forget the criminals who tortured her beautiful Megan.
It was difficult not to feel bitter about the events of the preceding year
She had shed so many tears in the past year since her daughter s murder
Nancy recognized that she was suffering from psychological problems and had really become indifferent to the events in her daily life
She began to shake and then to weep
When would there be an answer to this damn nightmare?
Megan had attended secondary school at a private girls school five hundred kilometers from home
In junior school she had been a straight A student
Now in high school she continued to study hard, play sports, join the school orchestra, plus a variety of school clubs
As a joke, her friends labeled her a genius, often just to make her angry.
As well as being a high academic achiever she had a great capacity for fun
She thrived on an active social life
Slender, pretty and vivacious , she was the apple of her parents eye
Every year in accordance with school policy, a student candidate was chosen to travel and live in another commonwealth country for six months.
As Megan had an interest in a diplomatic career after completing university, she figure she would be considered a prime applicant if she applied for the position
A detailed essay was necessary to provide the committee with a clear idea of her intention
The selection committee would spend a fortnight reviewing the applications in an attempt to identify the ideal student
Megan also needed to undergo a rigorous personal interview, which would validate her academic background and evaluate her general behavior.
The interview preceded well, Megan taking the initiative to underline her strengths
After school some of her friends gathered for coffee in the caf near the school
They confessed to Megan that they were rather envious of the opportunity she might have to live in another country
They enquired about the details of the interview
Two weeks later Megan received a phone call notifying her of the successful results of the interview.
Her parents were slightly nervous experiencing some negative feelings about Megan leaving the safety of home to live in another country
They knew the experience would broaden her horizons however, her destination, Montserrat, within the past year had a huge volcano erupt , disrupting people s lives
Unstable conditions, loss of homes and fear of more eruptions all tended to breed trouble among the poor of the island
Her parents concerns were for Megan s safety.
Departure day dawned clear and bright
Farewells were made to family and friends and she was off for the adventure of a lifetime
Megan s arrival on Montserrat was both welcoming and initially uneventful 
The island family where she was to live for the next six months, made her feels right at home.
As the pace of life on the island was more relaxed that at home, she was very happy
Her new schoolmates included her in their lives and she adapted quickly
Swimming in the warm ocean water, and sitting underneath waving palm trees in a mild climate, was a pleasant change from the cold northern winters.
One Saturday evening a gang of kids piled into a taxi, heading off for a barbecue on the beach
Some of the girls decided to walk along the beach
Megan joined them, lagging slightly behind
She knew she ought to hurry to catch up but the moist sand felt good under her feet
Water lapped at her toes; the tide was coming in
the violet light of dusk began to darken the sky.
In the growing darkness a van pulled alongside her, stopping with a squeal of brakes
Before she knew what was happening two masked men leapt out of the car and began to chase her, grabbing her and finally throwing her to the ground
The gross attack that followed was brutal and unexplainable
Initially Megan tried to fight off her attackers by clawing at their faces with her nails
Using a coil of rope to bind her hands, the men were free to proceed
First a fist broke her upper jaw leaving her unconscious.
Then the hoodlums used a metal rod to crush Megan s skull and finally a knife blade penetrated her neck piercing an artery 
After the crude act was completed her body was bundled into the back of a cab and discarded in a ditch in an isolated district far from the beach.
Realizing that Megan had disappeared, her friends dialed an emergency number, notifying the authorities of the situation
Once Megan s body was discovered, a warrant was issued for the immediate arrest of the two wanted men
Megan's parents were notified by the embassy
They in turn retained legal counsel and an intense inquiry began into the case
Those officials with an intimate knowledge of the island felt that the mugging was a case of mistaken identification and a complete misunderstanding , a misguided outlet for mounting frustrations on the island.
Megan s parents, Nancy and Don, cancelled all their immediate plans and flew to the island
Rather than wait for the small island ship to transport them to the island they were flown in by helicopter
After hiring a lawyer as an advocate for their cause , they began to work with the local police tracking down any angle of the case that would bring these creeps first to court and then to trial before a jury, who in turn would convict them to lengthy jail sentences.
As the days slipped by without any answers, they experienced severe emotional fatigue and life became a living hell
The investigation seemed to lag at first, but they were reluctant to interfere
The initial reports from this mess were inconclusive; many of the details not being addressed.
As paying clients they lodged a complaint with the Governor of the island
After several months passed, the authorities had a frank discussion with Megan s parents stating that as each day passed they were less and less liable to solve the murder
They cited other examples of unsolved cases and encouraged Nancy and Don to return home
Feeling both annoyed and frustrated, they decided they had done all they could here for the moment.
Once at home again, Nancy withdrew from community life choosing to spend her time alone
These days, if you went looking, you could often find Don in a local pub having a pint or two of beer
He, too, is unable to come to terms with the sequence of events that tore his family apart this year
Just thinking about Megan brings a lump to his throat and makes his head spin.
As time passed, it was becoming more and more evident that the stack of paperwork pertaining to his daughter s case was not going to provide any answers immediately, if ever
Tips provided by the public proved to lead nowhere
The records will remain open until the case is solved, however for the moment the natural rhythm of life has been destroyed
Can a family withstand such a tragedy? Only time will tell.
