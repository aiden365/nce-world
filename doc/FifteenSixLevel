The American Dream
The dream to construct a building to house everyone and everything connected with world trade began in the early 1960's.
After much deliberation, Minoru Yamasaki was commissioned over more than a dozen other architects to work with the firm of Emery Roth and Sons to design this massive edifice.
His task was evident: the building must have twelve million square feet of floor space on a sixteen acre parcel of land, accommodate the new facilities for the Hudson tubes and subway connections, and be done within the 500 million dollar budget.
The relatively small site combined with the vast space needs meant that the only way to go was up.
The development would dwarf its neighbors and change the New York landscape and skyline at the bottom of Manhattan.
In order to accommodate the nine million square feet of office space, Yamasaki made the decision that a two-tower development would be best.
This would serve the dual purpose of giving sufficient office area on each floor and allowing a manageable structural system while taking advantage of the superb views.
The twin towers would be 110 floors each, rising to a height of 1,353 feet (412 meters).
From the observation decks at the tops of the towers it would be possible to see 45 miles in every direction.
When asked why he designed two 110-storey buildings instead of one 220-storey building, he replied, flippantly, "I didn't want to lose the human touch." The first act in the construction process was the excavation.
The 1.2 million cubic yards of earth and rock that were removed were used to create 23 acres of fill in the Hudson River adjacent to the W. T. C. site.
This landfill project was subsequently developed as Battery Park.
The excavation, besides providing the foundation for this enormous construction, would house parking garages, subway terminals and tubes, and shopping concourses.
Yamasaki believed that all buildings must be strong in the context of being dominant.
He felt that each building should "be a monument to the virility of our society".
The structural system, while possessing this strength, is also impressively simple.
The 208-foot front wall is essentially a pre-assembled steel web, with columns on 39-inch centers, providing the wind bracing necessary for a building of this height, allowing the central core to take only the gravity loads.
This very light, economical configuration would result in keeping the wind bracing in the most efficient place, the outside shell of the building.
In this way, the wind force would not be transferred through the floor membrane to the core.
Thirty-three inch deep floors made of prefabricated steel trusses would act as supports to stiffen the outside walls against the buckling forces of the wind-load pressures.
There would be no interior columns in the office spaces, an amazing feat as there would be 40,000 square feet of office space on each of the upper floors.
In total, there would be seven buildings in the complex; the twin towers standing 110 stories high, four smaller towers, and a central plaza.
Also, there would be seven underground levels containing services, shopping, parking garages and a subway station.
When completed, there would be ten million square feet of leasable space, or an acre of rentable space on each floor of each tower.
The elevator system was intended to be fast, efficient, and space saving.
Express elevators opening onto the forty-first and seventy-fourth floors would serve the sky lobbies.
From these floors and from the plaza, four banks of elevators would carry passengers to each of the three zones.
Tenders posted, contractors hired, and the preliminary materials purchased, the groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 5, 1966.
Some offices were ready for occupancy in 1970 but the ribbon cutting ceremony wasn't held until April 4, 1973. Final cost 750 million dollars.
The institution of the W. T. C. would become a symbol of commerce and economic superiority to the world.
International businesses recognized that it would be advantageous to have offices there.
Thus, the working population of the W. T. C. would incorporate a cross-section of nationalities, not just Americans.
The buildings would be occupied by as many as fifty thousand people daily during the week.
Additionally, thousands of tourists could be in the center at any given time, visiting the restaurant, Windows on the World, atop One W. T. C., the indoor and outdoor observation decks on Two W. T. C., as well as the shops, exhibition pavilions, and the 250 room hotel.
A complex of this size is not without some problems, including fire. Numerous small fires and one major one on February 13, 1975 occurred over the years.
However, on February 26, 1993, a terrorist attack on the W. T. C. caused the largest incident ever handled by the City of New York's Fire Department.
The blaze, resulting from the ignition of a nitrourea bomb, with hydrogen cylinders to add impact, and located in the parking garage, required the response of 84 engine companies, 60 truck companies, and hundreds of personnel.
Firefighters maintained a presence at the site for 28 days, guarding against the possibility of further fires caused by the blast.
Six people died and 1042 were injured. The towers survived.
After this violent incident failed in its intended purpose of destroying the W. T. C., who could have envisaged an assault as disastrous as the one inflicted on it and the United States on September 11, 2001?
Who could have conceived an attack so vicious it would eclipse almost every man-made catastrophe?
Who could have foreseen that the American dream would blur into a terrible nightmare?
At 8;45 a.m. New York local time, a hijacked 767 commercial airliner with a full load of jet fuel for a transcontinental flight collided with One W. T. C...
The north tower, with enough impetus to carry it through to the opposite side.
Initially, terrorism was not a consideration in the mind of the public. This was merely a dreadful accident.
As a bewildered public endeavored to assimilate this overwhelming event, at 9:03 a. m., a second hijacked jet crashed into Two W. T. C.
Millions of people around the world, having been alerted to the incident and now watching the terror unfold on their televisions, watched in shock as the second plane, in the blink of an eye, entered the south tower at approximately the seventy-second floor and partially exited the opposite wall.
Fire and police departments were mobilized immediately. Rapid evacuation of the buildings was crucial.
Many workers on upper floors, knowing there was no escape, committed suicide by hurling themselves out of windows to their deaths.
Then, 62 minutes after it had been crashed into, the south tower crumbled into the streets in a gigantic cloud of dust and debris.
Hundreds of police and firefighters intent on their rescue mission lost their lives as Two W. T. C. collapsed.
Drivers and attendants of emergency vehicles, unable to abandon their posts, died where they had stopped to give aid and assistance.
Employees from the two towers, rushing to escape the raging fires, were caught in the wreckage.
Pedestrians, uncertain of which way to turn, and not convinced of the need for urgency, found themselves trapped in an avalanche of concrete.
Members of the media, on their way to cover the breaking news of the disaster, became victims of it.
Hundreds of commuters, on their way to work via subway, were trapped below ground with no escape possible.
Hospital emergency departments, having been notified of the explosions, quickly prepared for the arrival of casualties.
When the expected influx failed to materialize, it could only mean that there were few survivors.
One W. T. C. collapsed at 10:30 a. m., 105 minutes after being hit, adding to the mass confusion in the streets.
Seven W. T. C., a later addition to the complex, was damaged, caught fire, and collapsed later that afternoon. Not one of the adjoining structures was left intact.
In the aftermath of this incredible misfortune, the pieces of the puzzle began to be put in place.
Shortly before 8:00 a. m. on September 11, 2001, three commercial airliners were hijacked from Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts.
All were transcontinental flights with passengers destined for California and their full fuel tanks provided the ammunition critical to the mission of the hijackers.
Authorities speculate that the pilots were assassinated and their places taken by the terrorists who had had flight training.
In all, there were 157 passengers and crew on the two planes. The third plane crashed in Pennsylvania killing 45 passengers and crew.
A number of the hostages managed to use their cellular telephones to call their families to say goodbye.
Everything occurred in such a short period of time that, other than alerting a handful of people that there were some hijackings, no one had any idea why.
The dilemma was that there were no warnings, no demands for ransom, and no hints that this bright, sunny September morning was about to become a day that will live forever in the minds of those who witnessed the tragedy.
It will be years before the final toll of damage will be known.
To consolidate information, compute the financial losses, designate a monetary value for loss of life, fill the void left on the terrain, to make sense of this misfortune intended to undermine the foundation of America is a formidable assignment.
We do know that destruction of the World Trade Center cost the lives of more than three thousand innocent people in the buildings, in the hijacked airplanes, and in the surrounding streets.
Who can erase the mental images of those planes smashing into the twin towers?
Who is unable to visualize the spectacle of terrified men and women jumping to their doom?
How can those of us who observed the collapse of the buildings fail to dwell on the loss of life caused by men, cowards, who lacked the fortitude to proclaim war on their alleged enemy?
Today, October 22, 2001, nine more corpses were discovered in the rubble, the first such discovery in several weeks.
This may seem trivial when one considers the multitude of people who died.
However, the fatalities aren't the only victims of this tragic event. Their families, friends, and colleagues need closure.
They need to know with certainty that their loved ones are dead and they need to bury the remains.
Unfortunately, most of the casualties will probably never be found because the heat produced by the ignition of jet fuel and the damage incurred by the impact would have instantaneously vaporized everything and everyone in the immediate vicinity.
Others, in the buildings or on the streets as the towers collapsed are under so much debris that their bodies may not be found for months.
The list of buildings collapsed and damaged includes all seven buildings of the W. T. C. complex comprising W. T. C. 6, the U. S. Customs House to the north; W. T. C. 3, the 22 story Marriott World Trade Center Hotel just west of Tower Two; W. T. C. 4 and 5, the Plaza Buildings, and One Liberty Plaza, a 54 story, 743 foot high building to the east.
Firefighters and recovery workers remain on the scene. The fires still smolder beneath the ruins.
The American spirit has been bruised and the land has been scarred.
The citizens of this powerful nation now realize just how fragile and vulnerable their country is. Nevertheless, they are defiant.
They do not consider themselves easy prey for terrorists. They are still optimistic about their place in today's world.
They assert that the nightmare visited upon them will be visited upon the perpetrators of this cowardly act.
The World Trade Center is no more. The dream of an international axis of business, once a reality, will be revised.
Maybe having one place that is so prominent will also be rethought.
Whatever the outcome, this massacre has served to strengthen the resolve of a mighty nation. The dream and dreamers will survive.
