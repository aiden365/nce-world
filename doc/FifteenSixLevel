Acting Today for Tomorrow
Protecting the natural environment, the ecology of a country, is a major concern for every country these days.
It is mandatory not to minimize the importance of clean air, clean water, and clean land.
It is a sad commentary on today's society that industries have been permitted to contaminate our natural surroundings.
A dreadful discrepancy exists between the importance placed on economic development and the protection of the environment's heritage.
If allowed to proceed unchecked, the public will eventually inherit a major catastrophe.
Even countries who practice strict pollution control measures may still be affected by countries adjacent to or adjoining them, when air pollution permeates the air.
It is important for media coverage to compile accurate data to enable the public to boycott increased irresponsible industrialization.
To disguise the people's safety calling it progress will eventually lead to many casualties.
Canada has a land and water mass of 9,970,610 km2, with a population of 30 million people.
This is a country where the ratio of people compared to the mass of the land is very low.
Can you conceive that in such a gigantic land that a garbage problem exists?
I wish that I could reassure you that the answer is in the negative.
The commodity most needed to address this problem is space. However, as urban areas grow, the abundance of waste also increases.
Where once ample disposal sites were available, now every municipal government is scrambling to comply with and uphold local and national health regulations.
Large metropolitan cities are having an especially difficult time.
Local recycling programs have been authorized in many localities to safeguard the country's ecology.
Even after the establishment of such token measures, reports from five consecutive years have indicated only negligible progress in solving this very perplexing problem.
If we are to seriously address the problem we will need to minimize the amount of refuse we dispose of. New areas will need to be allocated for this purpose.
The database of information collected should be detailed enough to responsibly direct our future actions.
Every community, whether large or small, is searching for a solution to this problem.
Municipalities, in attempting to appraise the situation, have spent countless years in research, expending both time and money, looking for a homogeneous answer.
The public, hoping to avoid the tragic consequences of a manipulated decision, refuses to give enthusiastic support to most proposals.
Solicitors are hired to prepare confidential reports to convince the public to accept the municipalities suggestions.
The choice of a specific piece of farmland as a landfill site often causes an instantaneous hysterical reaction.
At local meetings citizens reproach government officials yelling their disapproval at the choice of a specific site.
They vent their anger but are not always able to mobilize sufficient public support to effect a wise and acceptable decision.
Even though researchers claim that lined pits will not cause a drainage problem, the room for error is marginal.
One flaw in the plan could be responsible for an epidemic or worse, causing multiple deaths.
Any leaching from a landfill pit will create recurring difficulties in polluting a farmer's well and the ground water.
Polluted water flowing into lakes will affect fish and wildlife and will hinder the sportsman's pleasures.
To articulate their concerns beforehand, will hopefully avoid grief in the future.
A veiled threat to public health immediately creates a bias towards protecting the people's safety and interests and establishing an educated suspicion.
The choice of using remote barren land removed from highly populated areas, virgin ground so to speak, presents its own problems.
The transportation of dangerous chemicals in sealed capsules over major arteries increases the possibility of spills and contamination.
Recurring excerpts in national and local newspapers warn of the dangers confronting the ordinary citizen.
The pretext of protecting the public interest must be questioned.
Accidents and poor planning lead to the erosion of public faith.
With certainty, we can report that the air we breathe is becoming more polluted daily.
For those residents of large cities who are afflicted with a respiratory condition it becomes imperative for officials to clamp down on smog conditions.
To protect their health, citizens may deem it necessary to check smog levels beforehand when they are planning strenuous outdoor activity.
To disregard this problem will surely increase the number of premature deaths and serious health problems.
Direct action by governments should help alleviate some of the risks for the elderly and those people with heart and lung disease.
One breakthrough occurred when the government signed a pact to check pollutant emissions on all motor vehicles.
Some continuity of policy is desirable not only between provinces but among nations to monitor air quality.
On a global scale the deforestation of the rain forests of Brazil is causing grave worldwide concern.
The present day regime that is encouraging the building of roads, allowing for easier travel has laid siege to one of the world's most valuable natural resources.
This has become an obscene rape of the land, a slash and burn approach.
An aerial view of this area shows terrible fires, enormous blazes every day, resulting in consequent air pollution.
The Brazilian government however, is reluctant to abolish this practice that would mean less income for the poor of Brazil.
Sadly, on the other hand, natives must evacuate their homes, becoming exiles.
A world forum on this matter has left people all over the world with some indefinite answers.
Both governments and individuals can voluntarily help achieve goals for a cleaner safer environment by incorporating some of the following ideas into their daily lives.
They can ascribe to the idea of participating in local recycling programs.
As well, they can cut back on the use of motor vehicles.
Walking more will improve everyone's health, as well as improving the environment.
Using alternatives to herbicides on lawns and gardens will improve water quality.
Some general advice might be to differentiate between what we need and what we want.
If we are going to pass on a healthy world to our children and grandchildren we must remain diligent and maintain a balance between our environmental and social responsibilities and our economic goals.
It's our world and how we leave it for the next generation depends on what we do today.
