A Solitary Quest
From my suite of rooms atop the Holiday Inn I surveyed the narrow alleys below me.
Only yesterday had I left my frantic North American life behind, to avail myself of an opportunity to travel to China.
I wished to spend time researching material for my thesis pertaining to Eastern religions.
The hotel was in close proximity to the heart of the old downtown.
Innumerable activities were happening below me. People surged along the street sometimes stopping to bargain with street vendors.
Cucumbers, tomatoes, apples, oranges and grapes were heaped on hand carts.
The variety of fruit available provided a virtual feast for the eyes.
Deliverymen jogged along pulling enormous loads of cardboard.
To a Westerner's eyes cars merged unbelievably without incident.
It appeared to be a dubious process to negotiate the traffic and even cross the street.
However, rather than lounging indoors, I decided to venture outside to explore the colorful world below.
I was interested in locating a church to attend, as today was Sunday.
On the street I made tentative enquiries about locating a Christian chapel.
At times the congestion of people hampered my progress. Stares from passers-by made me feel conspicuous.
The weather was hot and humid and there was some possibility of a typhoon reaching the city later in the day.
After several false leads I found myself standing in front of a very old Christian Church, established by missionaries during the last dynasty and at the beginning of the last century.
With the onset of a light sprinkle, I made a hasty retreat to shelter in the doorway of the church.
The familiar refrain of well-known hymns rang out within the church.
I felt drawn inside to join the fellowship in a foreign land.
Even though our languages differed, my gracious hosts nonetheless, made room for me, and made me feel welcome.
Sitting in this old church in China led me to contemplate about the lives of men and their spouses who lived decades ago, when they traveled to this distant land in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Many of these Christian ministers and laymen left their comfortable churches, even cathedrals to preach their ideology to foreigners.
They established small chapels where people could join in Christian fellowship and where some Chinese people accepted conversion to a new faith.
They came to a land where the predominate faith was Buddhism.
Even though their words were eloquent the message at times must have seemed formidable and gloomy.
Even the foreigners' clothing styles would have appeared queer.
During this colonial time period missionaries immigrated to all areas of China, visiting small villages, distributing Bibles, offering divine salvation and preaching the word of God.
A unanimous decision was made by many faiths to attempt to enrich the lives of others and to present the eloquent message of Christianity.
Some missionaries worked in the medical field as doctors, surgeons, nurses and dentists.
Agriculture specialists helped the farmers elevate their crop performance to provide better nutrition for the people.
Finally there were teachers who ran the mission schools. All had to be very versatile at their work.
These people proved to be an inspiration for others to follow in their footsteps.
Earnings from all these areas would go back into further mission work to fulfill their mandate.
In retrospect, my fascination with this historical era may have been kindled in childhood.
While visiting my grandparent's home every Thanksgiving, I was allowed to examine the fascinating ornaments from the Orient.
There were delicate elephant sculptures carved from ivory, lacy sandalwood fans and an imposing brass Buddha.
Best of all, I was allowed to don an exquisite silk embroidered jacket and play with a blue and tan parasol which was adorned with sprays of plum blossoms and tiny buds.
It was then I was introduced to an exotic new world.
Maybe this too, is partly what lured me to this country.
It would be a long time before visas would be issued to foreign people, to again live in China.
And so here I am! The clearance for my visitor's visa had been administered swiftly. My surroundings aroused in me a sense of heritage.
Today, sitting here pondering, allowed me to be a participant rather than just a spectator in a new chapter of China's history.
