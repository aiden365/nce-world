Sex Role Stereotypes
During my career as a Canadian female teacher, I observed many instances of sex role stereotyping throughout the western culture.
I was always amazed how quickly young children adopted the cultural values.
The topic is one of major concerns in the western world, yet there are those people who would ask you to believe that it is not a major issue.
People who wish to ignore the situation do not welcome discussions on the topic of gender bias.
This type of person evokes an analogy of an ostrich that buries its head in the sand to ignore a problem by avoiding it.
Although many of my comments may seem cynical, I give you assurance that they are based on my observation of western society for a number of years.
It might be interesting and informative to compare the western world in this respect with eastern cultures.
Many studies have been done and the breakdown of reasons examined to determine why gender roles play an important part in the selection of successful candidates for positions in many vocations.
These studies have made little impact on diminishing the prevalence of candidates being selected more for their gender than their qualifications.
Since the people responsible for hiring people to work with them, often hire people similar to themselves, it seems like they are looking for a clone or a duplicate of themselves.
Females often become quite indignant when positions that they are well suited for are awarded to males and ambiguous reasons given to explain why.
Is it any wonder that attempts to sue corporations for using unfair hiring and promotion practices are applauded?
On the other hand, companies who exhibit fair hiring practices need to be commended for doing so.
It has been common in the western world for people to presume that certain professions belong almost exclusively to one gender or the other.
The work of an electrician, or work with electronics, or repairing of air-conditioning equipment, might be considered to be masculine fields of employment.
Nursing and childcare vocations are considered feminine occupations.
Aviation is another field where people would usually assume that the pilot would be male and the flight attendant would be female, a premise that many times will be invalid.
It will be a major breakthrough when both genders are equally represented in the workforce especially in higher level positions.
Some individuals would lead you to believe that it would result in the breakdown of society, as we know it today.
At times an attempt to prevent subjective views being used to preclude only males being hired by males has been attempted.
Laws or policy that attempt to rectify the situation have not been successful in diminishing the problem.
An attempt to numerically control the number of positions in a corporation by using a quota system to require equal numbers of males and females to be hired usually meets with little success if the attitudes of the people doing the hiring are subjective and preclude the possibility of fair practises being used.
The empirical evidence shown by the numbers makes it easy to show which companies exemplify fairness and would hinder those who only make a feeble attempt to do so.
If a company does endeavour to incorporate fairness in their hiring practises, they should be eligible for commendation.
A diligent attempt to choose the best person for the position regardless of their gender is only inherent in those companies that can envisage a future with the best possible work force.
Advertisements depict gender bias while promoting products.
Looking at merchandise displays in any mall will reveal that a picture of a juvenile lad would be near construction equipment while an ad for perfume would likely show a female.
The drawback of this seemingly innocent way of displaying merchandise is that they tend to affirm the bias of the individuals who design them. This is a serious flaw.
Maybe the intent was not to be exclusive but that is the end result of the message that is evoked, whether subliminal or overt.
An alternate way of viewing the world, with either both genders portrayed or neither with the items, may seem bizarre but marketing specialists have been applauded for making the effort to do so.
The hypothesis has been suggested that if this practise were widespread it would facilitate a change for the better in the values that are embedded in our society.
When you read a biography in a newspaper in a metropolitan area, you will find that different words are used to describe males and females.
In almost any literary work, personal appearance is seldom mentioned when describing males, but commonly used when a female is the subject of the article.
Forms of address that are considered proper to use are also discriminatory. Males are always referred to as Mr.(except a very young lad might be addressed as Master).
There are several forms of abbreviations to use before the name of a female. It is permissible to use Mrs., Miss, or Ms.
The choice of abbreviation is by personal preference of the person being addressed but they have different meanings.
Mrs. is used to signify a married woman. Miss means an unmarried or single woman. Ms. could mean either and is the choice of many women because it does not reveal their marital status.
How strange that society feels it is necessary to be able to deduce a woman's marital status from her name by providing this form of definitive identification.
A man could be married or could be a bachelor and one is not able to ascertain his marital status from his name.
Why, then, is it necessary to differentiate between a woman who is married and one who is not?
Many of the cases of sexual harassment that are dealt with in corporations are a result of stereotyping.
Usually the person who is the alleged harasser is a male who supervises females.
Males have been taught by society that they are the privileged gender and have power over any female. This is the basis behind most incidents of harassment.
How strange that intelligent men feel entitled to take advantage of females in a subordinate position.
To heighten awareness, forums or symposiums are held to enlighten people about the importance of using inclusive language but may people still resist changing.
Some people are determined that the word man also includes woman. Sometimes the meaning does incorporate women and sometimes it doesn't.
However, many women insist that they are never quite sure of the meaning and suggest that the word humanity should be used instead when the intended meaning is both men and women and then there would be no confusion.
It is incomprehensible to others why they refuse to change.
A booklet or pamphlet is available for reference in most work places to help people use inclusive language in any writing in the workplace.
Some government offices have produced a leaflet that can be used by companies that do not have the impetus or the resources to design their own.
Studies about gender differences have suggested a hypothesis that females have better verbal skills, while males excel at tasks requiring the ability to visualize.
Conclusions of many of the studies have proved it invalid and found instead the differences between the genders to be almost nil.
There are, however, notable differences between individuals regardless of their gender.
The absurd criterion for judging a person's ability based on their gender needs to be abolished.
Until this is seen as being abnormal, the attempt to updated attitudes without removing the underlying cause of the societal values will be useless.
