Here I am, in China, half way around the world from home.
As I look at my clock and calculate the time back home I realize that half a world away, people are busy getting ready for a wedding.
The bride is my niece, a person I first met when she was three days old.
I think back to the first time I had the opportunity to become acquainted with my niece.
As my sister cradled her in her arms, the infant girl clasped her mother's outstretched finger.
My intuition told me that her temperament would be a sunny disposition, a joy to people around her.
As she grew, the cute little girl had an infectious laugh that started as a small grin, then became a giggle and grew louder and louder until it triggered a response from all the people around her and they joined in.
As an adolescent, she studied hard and enjoyed welldeserved success in secondary school as she interacted with her peer group.
After receiving her high school diploma, she chose nursing as her career.
From the beginning of the young couples romance it was evident that they were compatible and were completely intrigued with each other.
The couple had an engagement party when I was at home in Canada a few months ago.
The party was in the form of a picnic in a beautiful rose garden. To celebrate and to toast their future, we drank champagne.
As they posed under an arch covered with climbing roses, we snapped pictures for their photo album.
The couple decided on a fall wedding. Plans for the wedding day were activated immediately.
The decisions about the forthcoming event were shared by the whole family.
A close friend of the family was contacted and invited to sing a solo just prior to the ceremony.
The day before the ceremony, a rehearsal would take place so that the remainder of the details could be looked after and attended to.
The planning that takes place beforehand for one of these events and all the work that the big day entails, with many people collaborating to make the event run smoothly, are immense.
The conscientious attention to detail will be evident to the spectators of this event. I can imagine the excitement and emotions of the family today.
The time is near. The ceremony will begin in 3 short hours.
The bride will be radiant as she comes down the aisle escorted by her father. She will wear her grandmother's pearls as an accessory.
Her veil will be the same one as her cousin wore last year. As is customary, under her garments she will wear a blue garter.
As part of the tradition of Canadian weddings, she will be wearing something old (the pearls), something new (her gown), something borrowed (the veil) and something blue (the garter).
As the first chords of the wedding march are played (a melody familiar to all), the congregation will rise.
Gasps will be heard as they catch a glimpse of the bride in her gorgeous wedding gown.
The mother of the bride will calmly view this whole event, though tears will blur her vision. She will be overcome with sentiment at her daughter's apparent happiness.
The picture will be one that will embody hope for the future of humanity.
As the couple exchange wedding vows they will be affirming their love and making a commitment to each other.
All the spectators are there to wish them well.
As the time approaches, I think back to other family weddings over many years.
My older sisters were all married in the same church and as brides they carried a white Bible decorated with tiny roses.
The receptions for their weddings were all held in the same church basement, as there was no large banquet hall in the local area.
The feast was usually catered by a group of church members.
Today's wedding reception will be held in an arena that will be decorated with just the right amount of fall flowers in wonderful arrays to give it dignity yet a touch of glamour.
The table decorations will be a masterpiece.
One of the table decorations will be small pumpkins, used as containers for flowers that were collected from family gardens, surrounded by a large wreath made from long stalks of wheat.
There will be a few coloured leaves placed inside the wreath.
Maybe they will use oak and maple leaves to show the splendour of the autumn colours.
The colour of the outfits that the bridesmaids are wearing will be fall colours as well.
The ingenious decorations will be appreciated by the many guests attending the festivities.
At each place setting there will be a special paper napkin with the bride and groom's name printed on it and the date of their wedding.
It will be carefully folded placed on top and of a linen napkin.
This will be one of the souvenirs the guests will have to commemorate the special wedding day.
Also at each place will be a few after dinner mints for the guests. A miniature tree will also be placed at each persons place.
The intent is for the guests to take the little tree home and transplant it to a special place.
In this way, our environment is also improved and the tree will become a living tribute to the young couple.
The groom will carry her across the threshold as is customary for a young couple as they begin their new life together.
The honeymoon plans will take them to the west coast of Canada. They will have a week of privacy far away from friends and family.
They will inhabit a condominium in the town of Whistler, British Columbia, in the Rocky Mountains.
They will feel as if they are royalty living in a mansion in this little bit of paradise on earth.
Thereafter, they will return home to Ontario where they will reside.
Their original plan to spend their honeymoon on board a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea was abandoned when world circumstances dictated that our country Canada was a safer choice.
Earlier this month, as I thought about the forthcoming marriage, and knew that I would be unable to attend, I decided to write a message to the young couple.
The intent was that the message would be read aloud during the wedding reception.
In the message, I wished them well and urged them to cherish each other every day.
